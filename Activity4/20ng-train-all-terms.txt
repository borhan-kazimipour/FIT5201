sci.crypt	ripem frequently asked questions archive name ripem faq last update sun mar about this posting this is a still rather rough listing of likely questions and information about ripem a program for public key mail encryption it this faq not ripem was written and will be maintained by marc vanheyningen mvanheyn whale cs indiana edu it will be posted to a variety of newsgroups on a monthly basis follow up discussion specific to ripem is redirected to the group alt security ripem this month i have reformatted this posting in an attempt to comply with the standards for hypertext faq formatting to allow easy manipulation of this document over the world wide web let me know what you think disclaimer nothing in this faq should be considered legal advice or anything other than one person s opinion if you want real legal advice talk to a real lawyer questions and answers what is ripem ripem is a program which performs privacy enhanced mail pem using the cryptographic techniques of rsa and des it allows your electronic mail to have the properties of authentication i e who sent it can be confirmed and privacy i e nobody can read it except the intended recipient ripem was written primarily by mark riordan mrr scss cl msu edu most of the code is in the public domain except for the rsa routines which are a library called rsaref licensed from rsa data security inc how can i get ripem ripem contains the library of cryptographic routines rsaref which is considered munitions and thus is export restricted from distribution to people who are not citizens or permanent residents of the u s or canada therefore the following request is quoted from the readme file please do not export the cryptographic code in this distribution outside of the usa or canada this is a personal request from me the author of ripem and a condition of your use of ripem note that rsaref is not in the public domain and a license for it is included with the distribution you should read it before using ripem the best way to get it is to ask a friend for a copy since this will reduce the load on those sites that do carry it not to mention the humans that run them naturally this requires that you trust the friend ripem is available via anonymous ftp to citizens and permanent residents in the u s from rsa com cd to rsaref and read the readme file for info last i looked this site contains only the source tree and does not contain compiled binaries or the nice mac version ripem as well as some other crypt stuff has its home site on rpub cl msu edu which is open to non anonymous ftp for users in the u s and canada who are citizens or permanent residents to find out how to obtain access ftp there cd to pub crypt and read the file getting access for convenience binaries for many architectures are available here in addition to the full source tree will ripem run on my machine probably it has already been ported to ms dos and most flavors of unix sunos next linux aix ultrix solaris etc ports to macintosh include a standard unix style port and a rather nice mac like port written by raymond lau author of stuffit more ports are expected and help of users is invited will ripem work with my mailer probably how easy and clean the effective interface is will depend on the sophistication and modularity of the mailer though the users guide included with the distribution discusses ways to use ripem with many popular mailers including berkeley mush elm and mh code is also included in elisp to allow easy use of ripem inside gnu emacs if you make a new interface for ripem or create an improvement on one in the distribution which you believe is convenient to use secure and may be useful to others feel free to post it to alt security ripem what is rsa rsa is a crypto system which is asymmetric or public key this means that there are two different related keys one to encrypt and one to decrypt because one cannot reasonably be derived from the other you may publish your encryption or public key widely and keep your decryption or private key to yourself anyone can use your public key to encrypt a message but only you hold the private key needed to decrypt it note that the message sent with rsa is normally just the des key to the real message see what is des note that the above only provides for privacy for authentication the fingerprint of the message see what is a fingerprint like md is encrypted with the sender s private key the recipient can use the sender s public key to decrypt it and confirm that the message must have come from the sender rsa was named for the three men rivest shamir and adleman who invented it to find out more about rsa ftp to rsa com and look in pub faq or look in sci crypt what is des des is the data encryption standard a widely used symmetric or secret key crypto system unlike rsa des uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt messages however des is much faster than rsa ripem uses both des and rsa it generates a random key and encrypts your mail with des using that key it then encrypts that key with the recipient s public rsa key and includes the result in the letter allowing the recipient to recover the des key des is sometimes considered weak because it is somewhat old and uses a key length considered too short by modern standards however it should be reasonably safe against an opponent smaller than a large corporation or government agency it is not unlikely that future ripems will strengthen the symmetric cipher possibly by using multiple encryption with des what is pem and how does ripem relate pem is privacy enhanced mail a system for allowing easy transfer of encrypted electronic mail it is described in rfcs these documents have been approved and obsolete the old rfcs ripem is not really a complete implementation of pem because pem specifies certificates for authenticating keys which ripem does not handle at this time their addition is planned what s this about distributing and authenticating keys for a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you she must know your public key for you to be able to confirm that the message received came from her you must know her public key it is important that this information be accurate if a bad guy convinces her that his key is in fact yours she will send messages which he can read ripem allows for three methods of key management a central server the distributed finger servers and a flat file all three are described in the ripem users guide which is part of the distribution none of them provide perfect security why do all ripem public keys look very similar ripem public keys begin with a pkcs identifier describing various characteristics about the key so the first bunch of characters in your key may be the same as those of lots of other people s keys this does not mean your keys are similar but only that they are the same class of key were generated with the same program are of the same length etc what is a fingerprint like md md is a message digest algorithm produced by rsa data security inc it provides a bit fingerprint or cryptographically secure hash of the plaintext it is cryptographically secure because it is not possible in a reasonable amount of computation to produce a different plaintext which produces the same fingerprint thus instead of signing the entire message with the sender s private key only the md of the message needs to be signed for authentication md is sometimes used for other purposes for example it is often used to map an input of arbitrary length to bits of data as a passphrase interpreter or cookie generator md is described in its entirety including an implementation in c in rfc what is pgp pgp is another cryptographic mail program called pretty good privacy pgp has been around longer than ripem and works somewhat differently pgp is not compatible with ripem in any way though pgp does also use rsa some major differences between pgp and ripem pgp has more key management features particularly for users without a direct network connection ripem conforms to the pem rfcs and thus has a greater probability of working with other pem software pgp makes no attempt to be compatible with anything other than pgp in fact pgp is not compatible with pgp ripem uses rsaref a library of rsa routines from rsa data security inc rsaref comes with a license which allows noncommercial use pgp uses its own implementation of rsa which is not licensed thus pkp the firm holding the u s patents on the rsa algorithm claims that it is a infringement of that patent to make use or sell pgp in the u s or canada in acknowledgement of this pgp s original author phil zimmermann says in the documentation in fact if you live in the usa and you are not a federal agency you shouldn t actually run pgp on your computer because public key partners wants to forbid you from running my software pgp is contraband both pgp and ripem are export restricted and cannot be sent outside the u s and canada however pgp already exists on many ftp sites in europe and other places whether you use pgp or ripem or whatever the documentation to pgp is recommended reading to anyone interested in such issues note that the above facts both regarding patent and export restrictions are somewhat controversial many people think it shouldn t be that way and some people interpret various documents differently unfortunately discussions of it on the net inevitably seem to produce more heat than light and probably belong in misc legal computing see disclaimer what about rpem rpem stands for rabin privacy enhanced mail it was similar to ripem but used a public key cipher invented by rabin which is not rsa in an attempt to avoid the patent on rsa it was written by mark riordan the same author as ripem its distribution was halted when contrary to the beliefs of many including rabin public key partners pkp claimed that their patent was broad enough to cover any public key cipher whose strength rested in the difficulty of factoring products of large primes not just rsa this claim is not universally accepted by any means but was not challenged for pragmatic reasons rpem is not really used anymore it is not compatible with ripem or pgp what is mime mime stands for multipurpose internet mail extensions and is described in rfc you can find out about it in the newsgroup comp mail mime how pem should interact with mime is not yet entirely clear some people use the stopgap solution of having a mime type application x ripem in order to send ripem messages as mime ones i hope some standards will emerge draft internet documents exist on the matter i have this simple way to defeat the security of ripem you may wish to check the companion post ripem attacks which discusses some of the more obvious attacks on ripem s security and what procedures will minimize the risk ripem s main weak area is probably key distribution

integrity measures and non repudiation of origin always see what is pem ripem was written primarily by mark riordan mrr scss cl msu edu most of the code is in the public domain except for the rsa routines which are a library called rsaref licensed from rsa data security inc the current version of ripem is the current version of the macintosh port of ripem is how can i get ripem ripem uses the library of cryptographic routines rsaref which is considered munitions and thus is export restricted from distribution to persons who are not citizens or permanent residents in the u s or canada without an export license no such license has been obtained nor would one likely be granted unless the rsa key exchange were shortened to bits and the symmetric cipher changed to something weaker than des there are some suggestions that this situation may change now that clinton is in office the author requests in the readme file that this law not be violated please do not export the cryptographic

provides for disclosure protection for originator authenticity message integrity and non repudiation of origin services to be implemented the fingerprint of the message see what is a fingerprint like md is encrypted with the sender s private key the recipient or a dispute resolving authority can use the sender s public key to decrypt it and confirm that the message must have come from the sender and was not altered rsa was named for the three men rivest shamir and adleman who invented it to find out lots more about rsa and modern cryptography in general ftp to rsa com and look in pub faq some information also may be in sci crypt what is des des is the data encryption standard a widely used symmetric or secret key crypto system unlike rsa des uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt messages however des is much faster than rsa ripem uses both des and rsa it generates a random key and encrypts your mail with des using that key it then encrypts that key with the recipient s public rsa key and includes the result in the letter allowing the recipient to recover the des key des is sometimes considered weak because it is somewhat old and uses a key length considered too short by modern standards however it should be reasonably safe against an opponent smaller than a large corporation or government agency it is not likely that the pem standard will incorporate support for other symmetric ciphers in the near future because there is a strong feeling that pem should be stable so it can become utilized widely without early problems with interoperability what is a fingerprint like md md is a message digest algorithm produced by rsa data security inc it provides a bit fingerprint or cryptographically secure hash of the plaintext it is cryptographically secure because it is not possible in a reasonable amount of computation to produce a different plaintext which produces the same fingerprint thus instead of signing the entire message with the sender s private key only the md of the message needs to be signed for authentication md s can also be exchanged directly for authentication for example ripem public keys include an md of the public key in the file so parties wishing to confirm their keys are authentic via a separate channel merely need exchange md s of keys and verify their accuracy md is sometimes used for other purposes for example it is often used to map an input of arbitrary length to bits of data as a passphrase interpreter or cookie generator md is described in its entirety including an implementation in c in rfc there have been some recent suggestions that md may not be as strong a hash as was originally believed presumably some other hash function will be used if this is accepted as true what is pem pem is privacy enhanced mail a standard for allowing transfer of encrypted electronic mail generated over a long period of time by a working group of experts it is described in rfcs these documents have been approved and obsolete the old rfcs ripem is not really a complete implementation of pem because pem specifies certificates for authenticating keys which ripem does not handle at this time their addition is planned what s this about distributing and authenticating keys for a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you she must know your public key for you to be able to confirm that the message received came from her you must know her public key it is important that this information be accurate if a bad guy convinces her that his key is in fact yours she will send messages which he can read ripem allows for three methods of key management a central server the distributed finger servers and a flat file all three are described in the ripem users guide which is part of the distribution none of them provide perfect security the pem standard calls for key management by certificates the addition of this feature to ripem is planned but chicken egg issues still exist isn t it a bad idea to use patented algorithms in standards like pem this issue has been considered in the standards process rfc the specification for internet standards has a discussion section on what specifications for nondiscriminatory availability must be met for a patented method to be included in a standard rfc addresses this issue with regard to the patents covering public key cryptography this does not of course mean that all questions are settled or that everyone is in agreement an interesting exchange on the use of patented algorithms in standards with regard to public key cryptography is in the league for programming freedom archive available via ftp ftp uu net doc lpf in the files bidzos letter and bidzos response amusingly the lpf files on ftp uu net are compressed with a patented algorithm what about rsadsi pkp rsa data security inc rsadsi is a california based company specializing in cryptographic technologies public key partners is a firm which holds exclusive sub licensing rights of the following u s patents and all of their corresponding foreign patents cryptographic apparatus and method diffie hellman no public key cryptographic apparatus and method hellman merkle no cryptographic communications system and method rsa no exponential cryptographic apparatus and method hellman pohlig no pkp claims these four patents cover all known methods of public key cryptography the two businesses are rather closely related for example the same person jim bidzos is president of both of them pkp has licensed this technology to a considerable number of companies ibm dec motorola at t lotus for use in their products pkp has also threatened and filed lawsuits defending their patents ripem was originally created with no connection to rsadsi other than its use of the rsaref library and for no reason other than its author s desire to see widespread use of public key cryptography however after the ball started rolling people at rsadsi got interested rsadsi decided to carry ripem on its ftp site and some people there started making their own ripem keys and contributing code ripem even won the best application built on rsaref in award why do all ripem public keys look very similar ripem public keys begin with a pkcs public key cryptography standards identifier describing various characteristics about the key so the first bunch of characters in your key may be the same as those of lots of other people s keys this does not mean your keys are similar but only that they are the same class of key were generated with the same program are of the same length etc what is pgp pgp is another cryptographic mail program called pretty good privacy pgp has been around longer than ripem and works somewhat differently pgp is not compatible with ripem in any way though pgp does also use rsa a few major differences between pgp and ripem pgp has more key management features particularly for users without a direct network connection ripem conforms to the pem rfcs and thus has a greater probability of working with other pem software pgp makes no attempt to be compatible with anything other than itself ripem uses rsaref a library of rsa routines from rsadsi which comes with a license allowing noncommercial use pgp uses its own implementation of rsa pkp claims that it is a violation of its patents to make use or sell pgp in the u s or canada without either a license or written permission see disclaimer see what about rsadsi pkp phil zimmermann the author of pgp stopped distributing it after being threatened with legal action he believed that a licensing scheme could be arranged but it hasn t happened and there seems little prospect of it happening in the future he acknowledges in the pgp user s guide in fact if you live in the usa and you are not a federal agency you shouldn t actually run pgp on your computer because public key partners wants to forbid you from running my software pgp is contraband both pgp and ripem are export restricted and cannot be sent outside the u s and canada without an export license however pgp already exists on many ftp sites in europe and other places whether you use pgp or ripem or whatever the documentation to pgp is recommended reading to anyone interested in such issues unfortunately it s not distributed separately from the program which can be difficult to find in the u s on ftp sites due to liability concerns what about rpem rpem stands for rabin privacy enhanced mail it was similar to ripem but used a public key cipher invented by rabin which is not rsa in an attempt to avoid the patents on

yet entirely clear some people use the stopgap solution of having a mime type application x ripem in order to send ripem messages as mime ones i hope some standards will emerge draft internet documents exist on the matter what is tis pem trusted information systems is working on a version of privacy enhanced mail for general availability last i heard it was rumored to be integrated into an existing mail user agent mh rather than a stand alone system and in beta test i don t know much more than that i have this simple way to defeat the security of ripem you may wish to check the companion post ripem attacks which discusses some of the more obvious attacks on ripem s security and what procedures will minimize the risk ripem s main weak area is probably key distribution
sci.crypt	ripem frequently noted vulnerabilities archive name ripem attacks last update mar some possible attacks on ripem this is a living list of potential weaknesses to keep your eyes open for when using ripem for secure electronic mail it does not go into great detail and is almost certainly not exhaustive obviously many of the weaknesses are weaknesses of cryptographically secured mail in general and will pertain to secure mail programs other than ripem it is maintained by marc vanheyningen mvanheyn cs indiana edu it is posted monthly to a variety of news groups followups pertaining specifically to ripem should go to alt security ripem cryptanalysis attacks breaking rsa would allow an attacker to find out your private key in which case he could read any mail encrypted to you and sign messages with your private key rsa is generally believed to be resistant to all standard cryptanalytic techniques even a standard key about bits with ripem is long enough to render this impractical barring a huge investment in hardware or a breakthrough in factoring breaking des would allow an attacker to read any given message since the message itself is encrypted with des it would not allow an attacker to claim to be you des has only bits in its key and thus could conceivably be compromised by brute force with sufficient hardware but few agencies have such money to devote to simply read one message since each message has a different des key the work for each message would remain high key management attacks stealing your private key would allow the same benefits as breaking rsa to safeguard it it is encrypted with a des key which is derived from a passphrase you type in however if an attacker can get a copy of your private keyfile and your passphrase by snooping network packets tapping lines or whatever he could break the whole scheme the main risk is that of transferring either the passphrase or the private key file across an untrusted link so don t do that run ripem on a trusted machine preferably one sitting right in front of you ideally your own machine in your own home or maybe office which nobody else has physical access to fooling you into accepting a bogus public key for someone else could allow an opponent to deceive you into sending secret messages to him rather than to the real recipient if the enemy can fool your intended recipient as well he could re encrypt the messages with the other bogus public key and pass them along it is important to get the proper public keys of other people the most common mechanism for this is finger assuming the opponent has not compromised routers or daemons or such finger can be given a fair amount of trust the strongest method of key authentication is to exchange keys in person however this is not always practical having other people vouch for you by signing a statement containing your key is possible although ripem doesn t have features for doing this as automatically as pgp ripem does generate and check md fingerprints of public keys in the key files they may be exchanged via a separate channel for authentication playback attacks even if an opponent cannot break the cryptography an opponent could still cause difficulties for example suppose you send a message with mic only a pem mode which does not provide disclosure protection to alice which says ok let s do that your opponent intercepts it and now resends it to bob who now has a message which is authenticated as from you telling him to do that of course he may interpret it in an entirely different context or your opponent could transmit the same message to the same recipient much later figuring it would be seen differently at a later time or the opponent could change the originator name to himself register your public key as his and send a message hoping the recipient will send him return mail indicating perhaps even quoting the unknown message to defeat playback attacks the plaintext of each message should include some indication of the sender and recipient and a unique identifier typically the date a good front end script for ripem should do this automatically imho as a recipient you should be sure that the originator name header and the sender indicated within the plaintext are the same that you really are a recipient and that the message is not an old one some this also can and should be automated the author of this faq has made a modest attempt at automating the process of generating and checking encapsulated headers the programs are included in the standard distribution in the utils directory local attacks clearly the security of ripem cannot be greater than the security of the machine where the encryption is performed for example under unix a super user could manage to get at your encrypted mail although it would take some planning and effort to do something like replace the ripem executable with a trojan horse or to get a copy of the plaintext depending how it s stored in addition the link between you and the machine running ripem is an extension of that if you decrypt with ripem on a remote machine which you are connected to via network or worse yet modem an eavesdropper could see the plaintext and probably also your passphrase ripem should only be executed on systems you trust obviously in the extreme case ripem should only be used on your own machine which you have total control over and which nobody else has access to which has only carefully examined software known to be free of viruses and so on however there s a very real trade off between convenience and security here a more moderately cautious user might use ripem on a unix workstation where other people have access even root access but increase security by keeping private keys and the statically linked of course executable on a floppy disk some people will keep ripem on a multi user system but when dialing in over an insecure line they will download the message to their own system and perform the ripem decryption there however the security provided by such a mechanism is somewhat illusory since you presumably type your cleartext password to log in you ve just given away the store since the attacker can now log in as you and install traps in your account to steal your private key next time you use it from a less insecure line this will likely remain the situation as long as most systems use the rather quaint mechanism of cleartext password authentication i find it nice to put a brief statement of how carefully i manage my security arrangement in my plan next to my public key so that potential correspondents can be aware what level of precautions are in place some people use two keys a short one which is not carefully managed for ordinary use and a longer one which is treated with greater care for critical correspondence untrusted partner attacks ripem s encryption will ensure that only a person with the private key corresponding to the public key used to encrypt the data may read the traffic however once someone with that key gets the message she may always make whatever kind of transformations she wishes there exist no cryptographic barriers to a recipient say taking an encrypted message and converting it to a mic only message signed by you and readable by anyone although ripem does not provide this functionality indeed the latest pem draft i have seen specifically states that such transformations should be possible to allow forwarding functions to work including the recipients in the plaintext as mentioned above will make it possible for recipients of a redistributed message to be aware of its original nature naturally the security of the cryptography can never be greater than the security of the people using it

sci.crypt	licensing this thread brings up the more general question can any crypto implementation for which highly publicly scrutinized source code is not available ever be trusted after ibm had invented the des and the nbs had advertised for proposals but before ibm had decided to respond i argued strenuously that they should not they should keep it proprietary the biggest proponent of proposing was dr lewis branscomb dr branscomb was the ibm chief scientist and had come to ibm from nbs fortunately for all of us dr branscomb understood the answer to the above question much better than i he realized how difficult it would be to gain acceptance for any cryptographic mechanism because of the necessary complexity publicity would not be sufficient and neither would authority in fact it has taken both of those plus more than years we have also had independence the des was solicited by nbs invented and proposed by ibm and vetted by nbs it has also been examined and vetted by experts like adi shamir who are not subject to influence by any of these even now there are still people posting on this list who do not trust the des in spite of all the time all of the analysis and all of the public scrutiny of course it is just this point that nist misses when it attempts to gain acceptance for a novel mechanism developed in secret on the basis of authority alone we had a long thread here about whether or not the nsa can break the des that is a silly question at some cost and in some time they can break anything the important question is at what cost and in what time the fundamental strength of the des and rsa are not nearly so important as what we know about their strength as long as we understand the cost and duration for an attacker then we can use them in a safe way at this point we may never replace either because of the inability of any successor to overcome this knowledge gap des and rsa are among the most significant inventions of the century and the most important inventions in the history of cryptography we are damned lucky to have them william hugh murray executive consultant information system security locust avenue suite new canaan connecticut att wmurray whmurray at dockmaster ncsc mil

email address in the sense that this is their most unchanging face in the electronic realm this is your login name qualified by the complete address domain information for example ld longs lance colostate edu people see this address when receiving mail or reading usenet posts from you and in other situations where programs record usage some obsolete forms of addresses such as bitnet still persist in email messages additional information on the path that a message takes is prepended to the message received by the recipient this information identifies the chain of hosts involved in the transmission and is a very accurate trace of its origination this type of identify and forward protocol is also used in the usenet protocol to a lesser extent forging these fields requires corrupted mailing software at sites involved in the forwarding and is very uncommon not so uncommon is forging the chain at the origination point so that all initial sites in the list are faked at the time the message is created tracing these messages can be difficult or impossible when the initial faked fields are names of real machines and represent real transfer routes why is identity un important on the internet the concept of identity is closely intertwined with communication privacy and security which in turn are all critical aspects of computer networks for example the convenience of communication afforded by email would be impossible without conventions for identification but there are many potential abuses of identity possible that can have very severe consequences with massive computer networks at the forefront of the issue which can potentially either exacerbate or solve these problems verifying that an identity is correct is called authentication and one classic example of the problems associated with it is h g well s war of the worlds radio broadcast that fooled segments of the population into thinking that an alien invasion was in progress hoaxes of this order are not uncommon on usenet and forged identities makes them more insidious people and their reputations can be assaulted by forgery however the fluidity of identity on the internet is for some one of its most attractive features identity is just as useful as it is harmful a professor might carefully explain a topic until he finds he is talking to an undergraduate a person of a particular occupation may be able to converse with others who might normally shun him some prejudices are erased but on the other hand many prejudices are useful a scientist might argue he can better evaluate the findings of a paper as a reviewer if he knows more about the authors likewise he may be more likely to reject it based on unfair or irrelevant criteria on the other side of the connection the author may find identities of reviewers useful in exerting pressure for acceptance identity is especially crucial in establishing and regulating credit not necessarily financial and ownership and usage many functions in society demand reliable and accurate techniques for identification heavy reliance will be placed on digital authentication as global economies become increasingly electronic many government functions and services are based on identification and law enforcement frequently hinges on it hence employees of many government organizations push toward stronger identification structures but when does identification invade privacy the growth of the internet is provoking social forces of massive proportions decisions made now on issues of identity will affect many future users especially as the network becomes increasingly global universal widespread and entrenched and the positive or adverse affects of these actions intended and inadvertent will literally be magnified exponentially how does my email address not identify me and my background your email address may contain information that influences people s perceptions of your background the address may identify you as from a department at a particular university an employee at a company or a government worker it may contain your last name initials or cryptic identification codes independent of both in the us some are based on parts of social security numbers others are in the form u where the number is incremented in the order that new users are added to the system standard internet addresses also can contain information on your broad geographical location or nationhood however none of this information is guaranteed to be correct or be there at all the fields in the domain qualification of the username are based on rather arbitrary organization such as mostly invisible network cabling distributions the only point to make is that early fields in the address are more specific such as specific computer names or local networks and the later ones the most general such as continental domains typically the first field is the name of the computer receiving mail gleaning information from the email address alone is sometimes an inspired art or an inconsistent and futile exercise for more information see the faqs on email addresses and known geographical distributions below however unix utilities exist to aid in the quest see the question on this common suffixes us united states uk united kingdom ca canada fi finland au australia edu university or college com commercial organization org other e g nonprofit organization gov government mil military site how can i find out more about somebody with a given email address one simple way is to send email to that address asking another way is to send mail to the postmaster at that address i e postmaster address although the postmaster s job is more to help find user id s of particular people given their real name and solve mail routing problems the sysadmin i e root address may also be able to supply information users with related email address may have information however all of these methods rely on the time and patience of others so use them minimally one of the most basic tools for determining identity over the internet is the unix utility finger the basic syntax is finger user here there everywhere this utility uses communication protocols to query the computer named in the address for information on the user named the response is generated completely by the receiving computer and may be in any format possible responses are as follows a message unknown host meaning some aspect of the address is incorrect two lines with no information and a message in real life in which case the receiving computer could not find any kind of a match on the username the finger utility may return this response in other situations a listing of information associated with multiple users some computers will search only for matching user ids others will attempt to find the username you specified as a substring of all actual full names of users kept in a local database at some sites finger can be used to get a list of all users on the system with a finger address in general this is often considered weak security however because attackers know valid user id s to crack passwords more information on the fields returned by finger is given below more information on finger and locating people s email addresses is given in the email faq such as the whois lookup utility just as you can use these means to find out about others they can use them to find out about you you can finger yourself to find out what is publicly reported by your unix system about you be careful when modifying finger data virtually anyone with internet access worldwide can query this information in one amazing case the new york times writer j markoff uncovered the identity of r morris author of the internet worm through the use of an anonymous tip and finger see the book cyberspace by k hafner and j markoff why is identification un stable on the internet generally identity is an amorphous and almost nonexistent concept on the internet for a variety of reasons one is the inherent fluidity of cyberspace where people emerge and submerge frequently and absences are not readily noted in the community most people remember faces and voices the primary means of casual identification in the real world the arbitary and cryptic sequences of letters and digits comprising most email addresses are not particularly noticeable or memorable and far from a unique identification of an individual who may use multiple accounts on multiple machines anywhere in the world currently internet users do not really have any great assurances that the messages in email and usenet are from who they appear to be a person s mailing address is far from an identification of an individual anyone with access to the account e g they know the password either legitimately or otherwise can send mail with that address in the from line email addresses for an individual tend to change frequently as they switch jobs or make moves inside their organizations as part of current mailing protocol standards forging the from line in mail messages is a fairly trivial operation for many hackers the status and path information prepended to messages by intermediate hosts is generally unforgeable in general while possible forgeries are fairly rare on most newsgroups and in email besides these pathological cases abve there are many basic problems with today s internet protocols affecting identification on the internet internet mail standards described in rfc are still evolving rapidly and not entirely orderly for example standards for mail address munging or parsing tend to vary slightly between sites and frequently mean the difference between finding addresses and bouncing mail domain names and computer names are frequently changed at sites and there are delays in the propagation of this data addresses cannot be resolved when certain critical computers crash such as the receiving computer or other computers involved in resolving names into addresses called nameservers a whole slew of problems is associated with nameservers if they are not updated they will not find name addresses and even the operation of what constitutes updating has different interpretations at different sites the current internet mailing and addressing protocols are slightly anachronistic in that they were created when the network was somewhat obscure and not widespread with only a fraction of the traffic it now sees today a large proportion of internet traffic is email comprising millions of messages what is the future of identification on the internet some new technologies and standards are introducing facial images and voice messages into mail and these will improve the sense of community that comes from the familiarity of identification however they are not currently widespread require large amounts of data transfer standardized software and make some compromises in privacy promising new cryptographic techniques may make digital signatures and digital authentication common see below also the trend in usenet standards is toward greater authentication of posted information on the other hand advances in ensuring anonymity such as remailers are forthcoming see below privacy what is privacy on the internet generally while privacy has multiple connotations in society and perhaps even more on the internet in cyberspace most take it to mean that you have exclusive use and access to your account and the data stored on and and directed to it such as email and you do not encounter arbitrary restrictions or searches in other words others may obtain data associated with your account but not without your permission these ideas are probably both fairly limiting and liberal in their scope in what most internet users consider their private domains some users don t expect or want any privacy some expect and demand it why is privacy un important on the internet this is a somewhat debatable and inflammatory topic arousing passionate opinions on the internet some take privacy for granted and are rudely surprised to find it tenuous or nonexistent most governments have rules that protect privacy such as the illegal search and seizure clause of the u s constitution adopted by others but have many that are antithetical to it such as laws prohibiting secret communications or allowing wiretapping these rules generally carry over to the internet with few specific rules governing it however the legal repercussions of the global internet are still largely unknown and untested i e no strong legal precedents and court cases the fact that internet traffic frequently passes past international boundaries and is not centrally managed significantly complicates and strongly discourages its regulation how in secure are internet networks theoretically people at any site in the chain of sites with access to hardware and network media that transmits data over the internet could potentially monitor or archive it however the sheer volume and general noise inherent to this data makes these scenarios highly improbable even by government agencies with supposedly vast funding and resources technologies exist to tap magnetic fields given off by electrical wires without detection less obscurely any machine with a network connection is a potential station for traffic detection but this scenario requires knowledge and access to very low level hardware the network card to pursue if even possible a company network general inc is one of many that manufactures and markets sophisticated network monitoring tools that can filter and read packets by arbitrary criteria for troubleshooting purposes but the cost of this type of device is prohibitive for casual use known instances of the above types of security breaches at a major scale such as at network hubs are very rare the greatest risks tend to emerge locally note that all these approaches are almost completely defused with the use of cryptography how in secure is my account by default not very there are a multitude of factors that may reinforce or compromise aspects of your privacy on the internet first your account must be secure from other users the universal system is to use a password but if it is weak i e easy to guess this security is significantly diminished somewhat surprisingly and frighteningly to some certain users of the system particularly the administrator generally have unlimited access regardless of passwords and may grant that access to others this means that they may read any file in your account without detection furthermore not universally known most unix systems keep fairly extensive accounting records of when and where you logged in what commands you execute and when they are executed in fact login information is usually public most features of this auditing or process accounting information are enabled by default after the initial installation and the system administrator may customize it to strengthen or weaken it to satisfy performance or privacy aims this information is frequently consulted for troubleshooting purposes and may otherwise be ignored this data tracks unsuccessful login attempts and other suspicious activities on the system a traditional part of the unix system that tracks user commands is easily circumvented by the user with the use of symbolic links described in man ln unix implementations vary widely particularly in tracking features and new sophisticated mechanisms are introduced by companies regularly typically system adminstrators augment the basic unix functionality with public domain programs and locally developed tools for monitoring and use them only to isolate suspicious activity as it arises e g remote accesses to the passwd file incorrect login attempts remote connection attempts etc generally you should expect little privacy on your account for various reasons potentially every keystroke you type could be intercepted by someone else system administrators make extensive backups that are completely invisible to users which may record the states of an account over many weeks erased files can under many operating systems be undeleted most automated services keep logs of use for troubleshooting or otherwise for example ftp sites usually log the commands and record the domain originations of users including anonymous ones some software exacerbates these problems see the section on x windows in security indepedent of malevolent administrators are fellow users a much more commonly harmful threat there are multiple ways to help ensure that your account will not be accessed by others and compromises can often be traced to failures in these guidelines choose a secure password change it periodically make sure to logout always do not leave a machine unattended for long make sure no one watches you when you type your password avoid password references in email be conservative in the use of the rhost file use utilities like xlock to protect a station but be considerate be wary of situations where you think you should supply your password there are only several basic situations where unix prompts you for a password when you are logging in to a system or changing your password situations can arise in which prompts for passwords are forged by other users especially in cases where you are talking to them such as internet relay chat also be aware that forged login screens are one method to illegitimately obtain passwords thanks to jim mattson mattson cs ucsd edu for contributions here how in secure are my files and directories the most important privacy considerations are related to file rights and many lapses can be traced to their misunderstood nature or haphazard maintenance be aware of the rights associated with your files and directories in unix if the x execute right on your parent directory is off for users groups and other these users cannot gain information on anything in your directories anything less may allow others to read change or even delete files in your home directory the rights on a directory supersede the rights associated with files in that directory for a directory x means that access to the files or subdirectories in the directory is possible if you know their names to list the contents of the directory however requires the r right by default most accounts are accessable only to the owner but the initial configuration varies between sites based on administrator preference the default file mode specifies the initial rights associated with newly created files and can be set in the shell with umask the details of rights implementations tend to vary between versions of unix consult man pages on chmod and ls examples traver lance ls ld drwx ld jan users ld here is a listing of the rights associated with a user s home directory denoted by the columns at the left identify what rights are available the first column identifies the entry as a directory and the next three columns mean that read write and execute rights respectively are permitted for that user for directories the x right means that contents file and subdirectory names within that directory can be listed the subsequent columns indicate that no other users have any rights to anything in the directory tree originating at that point they can t even see any lower files or subdirectories the hierarchy is completely invisible to them traver lance ls l msg rw r r ld jan msg traver lance chmod u rw g o msg traver lance ls l msg rw ld jan msg here the modes on the file msg were changed to take away rights from group and other note that ls l file requires both the r right to get the list of files and subdirectories and the x right to access the files and subdirectories in order to get their size etc for example suppose the directory foo has rights dr r r the following is possible ls foo these commands would fail independent of file rights ls l foo ls l foo file cat foo file cd foo if the directory foo has rights d x x x the following are possible if it is known beforehand that foo contains an r readable file named file ls l foo file cat foo file cd foo the following commands fail ls foo ls l foo thanks to uwe waldmann uwe mpi sb mpg de for contributions here how in secure is x windows x windows is the primary software developed by the mit athena project which is funded by u s government grants to develop applications to harness the power of networks in enhancing computational tasks particularly the human computer interface the software implements a client server interface to a computer via graphical windows in this case the client is the application requesting or utilizing graphical resources such as windows or a mouse and the server is the machine that provides them in many situations the client is an application program running on the same machine as the server the great utility of x windows comes from its complete dissociation of the client and server so that windows may be broadcast to a server at a remote location from the client unfortunately this dynamic power also introduces many deep intricate and complicated security considerations the primary security and privacy issue associated with x windows is that much more sensitive data may be sent over a network and over wider regions than in the case where the human is situated near the host computer currently there is no encryption of data such as screen updates and keystrokes in x windows due to either intentional design decisions or unintentional design flaws early versions of the x window system are extremely insecure anyone with an account on the server machine can disrupt that display or read it electronically based on access to the device unix by any regular user there are no protections from this type of access in these versions the problem arises because the security is completely based on machine addresses rather than users such that any user at a trusted machine is himself trusted quoting from x documentation man xsecurity any client on a host in the host access control list is allowed access to the x server this system can work reasonably well in an environment where everyone trusts everyone or when only a single person can log into a given machine this system does not work well when multiple people can log in to a single machine and mutual trust does not exist with the access control list the xhost command may prevent some naive attempts i e those other than the direct access unix evasion the syntax as typed on the host machine is xhost name where name is the domain name or internet address of an authorized client machine by default clients running nonlocal to the host are disabled public domain programs to disrupt a display momentarily such as flip or slowly mirror the screen image or cause pixels to melt down to the bottom have been circulating on the internet among hackers for several years and played as pranks on unsuspecting or inexperienced users much more serious security breaches are conceivable from similar mechanisms exploiting this inherent weaknesses the minimal easily bypassed trusted security mode of xhost has been jokingly referred to as x hanging open security terrible new versions of the x window system x r and higher by default make server access as secure as the file system using a xauthority file and magic cookies remote machines must have a code in the xauthority file in the home directory that matches the code allowed by the server many older programs and even new vendor supplied code does not support or is incompatible with magic cookies the basic magic cookie mechanism is vulnerable to monitoring techniques described earlier because no encryption of keys occurs in transmission x r also includes other sophisticated encryption mechanisms try man xsecurity to find out what is supported at your site even though improved security mechanisms have been available in x windows since local sites often update this software infrequently because installation is extremely complex thanks to marc vanheyningen mvanheyn whale cs indiana edu jim mattson mattson cs ucsd edu and bill marshall marshall cs iastate edu for contributions here how in secure is my email by default not very the characters that you are reading are almost certainly encoded in ascii the american standard code for information interchange that maps alphabetic and symbolic characters onto numeric codes and vice versa virtually every computer system uses this code and if not has ways of converting to and from it when you write a mail message by default it is being sent in ascii and since the standard is virtually universal there is no intrinsic privacy despite milleniums worth of accumulated cryptographic knowledge cryptographic technologies are only recently being established that afford high priority to privacy as a primary criteria in computer and network design some potential pitfalls in privacy are as follows the most serious threats are instances of immature or unscrupulous system operators reading private mail in the spool files at a local site i e at the source or destination of the message such as a university system administrators may also release files to law enforcement agencies but conventions and protocols for warrants involving computer searches have still not been strongly established and tested legally note that bounced messages go to postmasters at a given site in their entirety this means that if you address mail with an incorrect address it has a good chance of being seen by a human other than the recipient typically new user accounts are always set up such that the local mail directory is private but this is not guaranteed and can be overridden finally be aware that some mailing lists email addresses of everyone on a list are actually publicly accessable via mail routing software mechanisms this feature can be disabled most potential compromises in email privacy can be thoroughly avoided with the use of strong end to end cryptography which has its own set of caveats for example unscrupulous administrators may still be a threat if the encryption site is shared or nonlocal see the sections on email privacy and email policies how am i not liable for my email and postings as punishment or whatever your system administrator can revoke certain privileges such as emailing usenet posting or reading certain groups file transferring remote communications or generally any subset of capabilities available from your account this all is completely at the discretion of the local administrator and under the procedures followed at a particular site which in many cases are haphazard and crisis oriented currently there are virtually no widespread uniform guidelines or procedures for restricting use to any internet services and local administrators are free to make arbitrary decisions on access today punitive measures are regularly applied in various situations in the typical scenario complaint s reach a system adminstrator regarding abuses by a user usually but not necessarily preceded by complaints to the user in email regarding that person s objectionable email or postings abusive posters to usenet are usually first given admonitions from their system administrators as urged by others on the net the debate persists endlessly on many newsgroups whether this is also used as a questionable means of attacking or silencing harmless crackpots or censoring unpopular opinions system administrators at remote sites regularly cooperate to squelch severe cases of abuse in general however by tradition usenet readers are remarkably tolerant of diverse views and uses of the system but a colorful vocabularly of slang helps describe their alternatives when this patience is sapped the options wielded by the individual user are to simply advance to the next message referred to as hitting the n key or to plonk annoying posters according to the hacker s dictionary the sound a jerk makes at the end of a fall to the bottom of a kill file in cases where punitive actions are applied generally system administrators are least likely to restrict email usenet postings are much more commonly restricted either to individual users or entire groups such as a university campus restrictions are most commonly associated with the following abuses harassing or threatening notes email terrorism illegal uses e g piracy or propagation of copyrighted material ad hominem attacks i e insulting the reputation of the poster instead of citing the content of the message intentional or extreme vulgarity and offensiveness inappropriate postings esp binary files in regular groups mail bombing inundating mail boxes with numerous or massive files major problems originate from lack of distinctions in private and official email or postings most users have internet access via accounts at businesses or universities and their activities on the internet can be construed as representative of their parent organizations many people put disclaimers in their signatures

liability notes on university liability for usenet how do i provide more less information to others on my identity the public information of your identity and account is mostly available though the unix utility finger described above you have control over most of this information with the utility chfn the specifics vary between sites on some systems use passwd f you can provide unlimited information in the plan file which is copied directly to the destination during the fingering a technique that works at some sites allows you to find out who is finger ing you and even to vary the plan file sent to them your signature is determined by the environment variable signature usenet signatures are conventionally stored in the signature file in your home directory providing less information on your online identity is more difficult and involved one approach is to ask your system adminstrator to change or delete information about you such as your full name you may be able to obtain access on a public account or one from someone unrelated to you personally you may be able to remotely login via modem or otherwise to computers that you are not physically near these are tactics for hiding or masking your online activities but nothing is foolproof consult man pages on the chmod command and the default file mode generally files on a shared system have good safeguards within the user pool but very little protection is possible from corrupt system administrators to mask your identity in email or on usenet you can use different accounts more untraceable are new anonymous posting and remailing services that are very recently being established see below who is my sysadmin what does s he know about me the requirements and screening for getting a system administration job and thereby access to all information on a system vary widely between sites and are sometimes frighteningly lax especially at universities many unix systems at universities are largely managed by undergraduates with a background in computing and often hacking in general commercial and industrial sites are more strict on qualifications and background and government sites are extremely strict the system adminstrator root user can monitor what commands you used and at what times s he may have a record backups of files on your account over a few weeks s he can monitor when you send email or post usenet messages and potentially read either s he may have access to records indicating what hosts you are using both locally and elsewhere administrators sometimes employ specialized programs to track strange or unusual activity which can potentially be misused why is privacy un stable on the internet for the numerous reasons listed above privacy should not be an expectation with current use of the internet furthermore large parts of the internet are funded by the u s nsf national science foundation which places certain restrictions on its use such as prohibiting commercial use some high level officials in this and other government agencies may be opposed to emerging techniques to guarantee privacy such as encryption and anonymous services historically the major threats to privacy on the internet have been local perhaps the most common example of this are the widespread occurrences of university administrators refusing to carry some portion of usenet newsgroups labelled as pornographic the alternative hierarchy in the usenet system which has virtually no restrictions on propagation and new group creation is frequently targeted although this material may appear anywhere from the global point of view traffic is generally completely unimpeded on the internet and only the most egregious offenders are pursued for example verbatim transcriptions of copyrighted material such as newspaper or magazine articles are posted to usenet with regularity without major consequences some email complaints may ensue more astonishing to some is that currently significant portions of usenet traffic and less so internet traffic is comprised of sexually explicit digitized images almost entirely originating from copyrighted material newsgroups such as alt sex regularly have the highest traffic what is the future of privacy on the internet some argue that the internet currently has an adequate or appropriate level of privacy others will argue that as a prototype for future global networks it has woefully inadequate safeguards the internet is growing to become a completely global international superhighway for data and this traffic will inevitably entail data such as voice messages postal mail and many other items of extremely personal nature computer items that many people consider completely private such as their local hard drives will literally be inches from global network connections also sensitive industrial and business information is exchanged over networks currently and this volume may conceivably merge with the internet most would agree that for these basic but sensitive uses of the internet no significant mechanisms are currently in place to ensure much privacy new standards are calling for uniform introduction of privacy enhanced mail pem which uses encryption technologies to ensure privacy so that privacy protection is automatic and may significantly improve safeguards the same technology that can be extremely destructive to privacy such as with surreptitious surveilance can be overwhelmingly effective in protecting it e g with encryption some government agencies are opposed to unlimited privacy in general and believe that it should lawfully be forfeited in cases of criminal conduct e g court authorized wiretapping however powerful new technologies to protect privacy on computers are becoming increasingly popular provoking some to say that the cat is out of the bag and the genie can t be put back in the bottle in less idiomatic terms they believe that the spread of strong cryptography is already underway will be socially and technically unstoppable to date no feasible system that guarantees both secure communication and government oversight has been proposed the two goals are largely incompatible proposals for registration of secret keys by d denning on sci crypt for example have been met with hot controversy at best and ridicule and derision at worst mainly because of concerns for the right to privacy and objections of inherent feasibility electronic privacy issues and particularly the proper roles of networks and the internet will foreseeably become highly visible and explosive over the next few years anonymity what is anonymity on the internet simply stated anonymity is the absence of identity the ultimate in privacy however there are several variations on this simple theme a person may wish to be consistently identified by a certain pseudonym or handle and establish a reputation under it in some area providing pseudo anonymity a person may wish to be completely untraceable for a single one way message a sort of hit and run or a person may wish to be openly anonymous but carry on a conversation with others with either known or anonymous identities via an anonymous return address a user may wish to appear as a regular user but actually be untraceable sometimes a user wishes to hide who he is sending mail to in addition to the message itself the anonymous item itself may be directed at individuals or groups a user may wish to access some service and hide all signs of the association all of these uses are feasible on the internet but are currently tricky to carry out in practice because of all the tracking mechanisms inherent to operating systems and network protocols officials of the nsf and other government agencies may be opposed to any of these uses because of the potential for abuse nevertheless the inherent facelessness of large networks will always guarantee a certain element of anonymity why is anonymity un important on the internet anonymity is another powerful tool that can be beneficial or problematic depending on its use arguably absence of identification is important as the presence of it it may be the case that many strong benefits from electronic anonymity will be discovered that were unforeseen and unpredicted because true anonymity has been historically very difficult to establish one can use anonymity to make personal statements to a colleague that would sabotage a relationship if stated openly such as employer employee scenarios one can use it to pass information and evade any threat of direct retribution for example whistleblowers reporting on government abuses economic social or political can bring issues to light without fear of stigma or retaliation sensitive personal potentially damaging information is often posted to some usenet groups a risky situation where anonymity allows conversations to be carried on completely independent of the identities of the participants some police departments run phone services that allow anonymous reporting of crimes such uses would be straightforward on the network unfortunately extortion and harassment become more insidious with assurances of anonymity how can anonymity be protected on the internet the chief means as alluded to above are masking identities in email and posting however anonymous accounts public accounts as accessable and anonymous as e g public telephones may be effective as well but this use is generally not officially supported and even discouraged by some system adminstrators and nsf guidelines the nonuniformity in the requirements of obtaining accounts at different sites and institutions makes anonymous accounts generally difficult to obtain to the public at large many communications protocols are inherently detrimental to anonymity virtually every protocol in existence currently contains information on both sender and receiver in every packet new communications protocols will likely develop that guarantee much higher degrees of secure anonymous communication what is anonymous mail one approach to anonymizing mail has been to set up an anonymous server that when activated by email to its address responds by allocating and supplying an anonymous id that is unique to the person requesting it based on his email address this will vary for the same person for different machine address email originations to send anonymous mail the user sends email directed to the server containing the final destination the server anonymizes the message by stripping of identification information and forwards the message which appears to originate from the anonymous server only from the corresponding anonymous user id this is the interactive use of anonymity or pseudonymity mentioned above another more fringe approach is to run a cypherpunk remailer from a regular user account no root system privileges are required these are currently being pioneered by eric hughes and hal finney hal alumni caltech edu the operator runs a process on a machine that anonymizes mail sent to him with certain characteristics that distinguish it from his regular incoming mail typically fields in the header one has been implemented as a perl script running on unix several of these are in existence currently but sites and software currently are highly unstable they may be in operation outside of system administrator knowledge the remailers don t generally support anonymous return addresses mail that is incorrectly addressed is received by the operator generally the user of the remailer has to disavow any responsibility for the messages forwarded through his system although actually may be held liable regardless these approaches have several serious disadvantages and weaknesses the anonymous server approach requires maintaining a mapping of anonymous id s to real addresses that must be maintained indefinitely one alternative is to allow deallocation of aliases at the request of the user but this has not been implemented yet although an unlikely scenario traffic to any of these sites could conceivably be monitored from the outside necessitating the use of cryptography for basic protection local administrators can shut them down either out of caprice or under pressure from local network or government agencies unscrupulous providers of the services can monitor the traffic that goes through them most remailers currently keep logs that may be inspected the cypherpunk approach tends to be highly unstable because these operators are basically network users who do not own the equipment and are accountable to their own system administrators who may be unaware of the use and unsympathetic to the philosophy of anonymity when the operation is discovered regarding it as illicit use in all cases a high degree of trust is placed in the anonymous server operator by the user currently the most direct route to anonymity involves using smtp protocols to submit a message directly to a server with arbitrary field information this practice not uncommon to hackers and the approach used by remailers is generally viewed with hostility by most system administrators information in the header routing data and logs of network port connection information may be retained that can be used to track the originating site in practice this is generally infeasible and rarely carried out some administrators on the network will contact local administrators to request a message be tracked and its writer admonished or punished more severely such as revoking the account all of this actually happening occasionally but infrequently see the sections known anonymous mail and posting sites and responsibilities associated with anonymity what is anonymous posting anonymous servers have been established as well for anonymous usenet posting with all the associated caveats above monitored traffic capricious or risky local circumstances logging make sure to test the system at least once by e g anonymous posting to misc test however some operators don t recommend this because many sites autorespond to test messages possibly causing the anonymous server to allocate anonymous ids for those machines see the responsibilties associated with anonymous posting before proceeding another direct route involves using nntp protocols to submit a message directly to a newserver with arbitrary field information this practice not uncommon to hackers is also generally viewed with hostility by most system administrators and similar consequences can ensue see the sections known anonymous mail and posting sites and responsibilities associated with anonymity why is anonymity un stable on the internet as noted many factors compromise the anonymity currently available to the general internet community and these services should be used with great caution to summarize the technology is in its infancy and current approaches are unrefined unreliable and not completely trustworthy no standards have been established and troubling situations of loss of anonymity and bugs in the software are prevalent here are some encountered and potential bugs one anonymous remailer reallocated already allocated anonymous return addresses others passed signature information embedded in messages unaltered address resolution problems resulting in anonymized mail bounced to a remailer are common forgeries to the anonymous server itself are a problem possibly allowing unauthorized users to potentially glean anon id email address mappings in the alias file this can be remedied with the use of passwords infinite mail loops are possible with chaining remailers source code is being distributed tested and refined for these systems but standards are progressing slowly and weakly the field is not likely to improve considerably without official endorsement and action by network agencies the whole idea is essentially still in its infancy and viewed with suspicion and distrust by many on the internet seen as illegitimate or favorable to criminality the major objection to anonymity over regular internet use is the perceived lack of accountability to system operators i e invulnerability to account restrictions resulting from outside complaints system adminstrators at some sites have threatened to filter anonymous news postings generated by the prominent servers from their redistribution flows this may only have the effect of encouraging server operators to create less characteristically detectable headers probably the least problematic approach and the most traditional to usenet is for individual users to deal with anonymous mail however they prefer e g ignoring it or filtering it with kill files what is the future of anonymity on the internet new anonymous protocols effectively serve to significantly increase safeguards of anonymity for example the same mechanism that routes email over multiple hosts thereby threatening its privacy can also be used to guarantee it in a scheme called chaining an anonymous message is passed through multiple anonymous servers before reaching a destination in this way generally multiple links of the chain have to be broken for security to be compromised re encryption at each link makes this scenario even more unlikely even more significantly the anonymous remailers could be spread over the internet globally so that local weaknesses such as corrupt governments or legal wiretapping within a nation would be more unlikely to sacrifice overall security by message tracing however remailers run by corrupt operators are possible the future of anonymous services on the internet is at this time highly uncertain and fraught with peril while specific groups seem to benefit significantly from anonymous posting capabilities many feel that unlimited newsgroup scope for anonymous posting is a disruptive and dangerous idea and detracts from discussions in serious groups the introduction of unlimited group anonymity may have fundamental repercussions on usenet conventions and distribution mechanisms such as moderated and alt groups have had in the past for example as part of new group creation the charter may specify whether anonymous posting is un welcome nevertheless the widespread introduction and use of anonymity may be inevitable based on traffic statistics anonymous services are in huge demand pervasive and readily available anonymity could carry significant and unforeseen social consequences however if its use is continued to be generally regarded as subversive it may be confined to the underground the ramifications of widespread introduction of anonymity to usenet are still largely unknown it is unclear whether it will provoke signficant amounts of new traffic or instead of expansion cause a shift where a greater portion of existing traffic is anonymized conceivably the services could play a role in influencing future

many on their meaning especially on the internet in the general news media in the past a person who uses computers and networks to malicious ends such as breaking into systems has been referred to as a hacker but most internet users prefer the term cracker for this instead a hacker is perceived as a benign but intensely ambitious curious and driven computer user who explores obscure areas of a system for example something of a proud electronic pioneer and patriot this is the sense intended in this document see also the hacker s dictionary and the faq alt security faq what is a cypherpunk

mailing list below see also the cryptoanarchist manifesto and the cryptography glossary in soda berkeley edu pub cypherpunks what is steganography and anonymous pools closely associated with encryption is steganography or the techniques for not only pursuing private encrypted communication but concealing the very existence of the communication itself many new possibilities in this area are introduced with the proliferation of computer technology for example it is possible to encode messages in the least significant bits of images typically the most noisy in addition when such an item is posted in a public place such as a newsgroup virtually untraceable communication can take place between sender and receiver for steganographic communications in the electronic realm one another possibility is setting up a mailing list where individual messages get broadcast to the entire list and individual users decode particular messages with their unique key an anonymous pool has been set up by miron cuperman miron extropia wimsey com for experiments send email to pool request extropia wimsey com with one of the following commands in the subject line subscribe unsubscribe help what is security through obscurity security through obscurity refers to the attempt to gain protection from system weaknesses by hiding sensitive information or programs relating to them for example a company may not make public information on its software s encryption techniques to evade attacks based on knowledge of it another example would be concealing data on the existence of security holes or bugs in operating systems or some reliance may be made on the fact that some standard or mechanism with potential problems is serious because they are not widely known or not widely used this argument is occasionally applied to mechanisms for email and usenet posting forgery security through obscurity is regarded as a very feeble technique at best and inappropriate and ineffective at worst also called the head in the sand approach see the faq for alt security some remarks of john perry barlow cofounder of the electronic frontier foundation directed to nsa agents at the first international symposium on national security national competitiveness held in mclean virginia dec digitized information is very hard to stamp classified or keep contained this stuff is incredibly leaky and volatile it s almost a life form in its ability to self propagate if something hits the net and it s something which people on there find interesting it will spread like a virus of the mind i believe you must simply accept the idea that we are moving into an environment where any information which is at all interesting to people is going to get out and there will be very little that you can do about it this is not a bad thing in my view but you may differ what are identity daemons rfc describes a protocol standard that allows unix programs to query a remote user s login name after connection to a local communication socket a connection of this type is established during ftp and telnet sessions for example the standard is not widely supported perhaps of internet sites currently implement it but the number is increasing the mechanism is detrimental to anonymity regular users cannot disable it but system adminstrators can circumvent it this standard may represent a trend toward greater

credit card fraud and long distance call thievery see ftp eff org pub sjg general information effector operation sundevil the phoenix inspired crackdown of may concentrated on telephone code fraud and credit card abuse and followed this seizure plan with some success bulletin board systems went down all over america terrifying the underground and swiftly depriving them of at least some of their criminal instruments it also saddled analysts with some floppy disks and confronted harried justice department prosecutors with the daunting challenge of a gigantic nationwide hacker show trial involving highly technical issues in dozens of jurisdictions massive show trials never materialized although isolated instances of prosecution were pursued the movement reached a crescendo in texas with the highly publicized case of illegal search and seizure involving the steve jackson games company of austin texas on march from the column gurps labour lost by bruce sterling bruces well sf ca us in fantasy and science fiction magazine in an early morning raid with an unlawful and unconstitutional warrant agents of the secret service conducted a search of the sjg office when they left they took a manuscript being prepared for publication private electronic mail and several computers including the hardware and software of the sjg computer bulletin board system yet jackson and his business were not only innocent of any crime but never suspects in the first place the raid had been staged on the unfounded suspicion that somewhere in jackson s office there might be a document compromising the security of the telephone system fbi agents involved in the seizure were named in a civil suit filed on behalf of steve jackson games by the electronic frontier foundation see information on eff below from an article by joe abernathy in the houston chronicle feb austin an electronic civil rights case against the secret service closed thursday with a clear statement by federal district judge sam sparks that the service failed to conduct a proper investigation in a notorious computer crime crackdown and went too far in retaining custody of seized equipment secret service special agent timothy foley of chicago who was in charge of three austin computer search and seizures on march that led to the lawsuit stoically endured spark s rebuke over the service s poor investigation and abusive computer seizure policies while the service has seized dozens of computers since the crackdown began in this is the first case to challenge the practice sparks grew visibly angry when it was established that the austin science fiction magazine and game book publisher was never suspected of a crime and that agents did not do even marginal research to establish a criminal connection between the firm and the suspected illegal activities of an employee or to determine that the company was a publisher indeed agents testified that they were not even trained in the privacy protection act at the special secret service school on computer crime how long would it have taken you mr foley to find out what steve jackson games did what it was asked sparks an hour was there any reason why on march you could not return to steve jackson games a copy in floppy disk form of everything taken did you read the article in business week magazine where it had a picture of steve jackson a law abiding tax paying citizen saying he was a computer crime suspect did it ever occur to you mr foley that seizing this material could harm steve jackson economically foley replied no sir but the judge offered his own answer you actually did you just had no idea anybody would actually go out and hire a lawyer and sue you more than has been spent by the electronic frontier foundation in

privacy experts software manufacturers and telephone companies the fbi proposed legislation to amend the communications act of to make it easier for the bureau to perform electronic wiretapping the proposed legislation entitled digital telephony would have required communications service providers and hardware manufacturers to make their systems tappable by providing back doors through which law enforcement officers could intercept communications furthermore this capability would have been provided undetectably while the communications was in progress exclusive of any communications between other parties regardless of the mobility of the target of the fbi s investigation and without degradation of service under the proposal the department of justice doj can keep communications products off the market if it determines that these products do not meet the doj s own guidelines this could result in increased costs and reduced competitiveness for service providers and equipment manufacturers since they will be unlikely to add any features that may result in a doj rejection of their entire product the fbi proposal suggests that the cost of this wiretapping service to the bureau would have to be borne by the service provider itself the electronic frontier foundation organized a broad coalition of public interest and industry groups from computer professionals for

person it s up to you to learn how to speak english properly and make whatever use you please of it though the government provides certain subsidies to help you learn to read and write a bit otherwise everybody just sort of pitches in and somehow the thing evolves on its own and somehow turns out workable and interesting fascinating even though a lot of people earn their living from using and

are mostly untested problematic or unsupported at this time what are the responsibilities associated with anonymity users use anonymity only if you have to frivolous uses weaken the seriousness and usefulness of the capability for others do not use anonymity to provoke harass or threaten others do not hide behind anonymity to evade established conventions on usenet such as posting binary pictures to regular newsgroups if posting large files be attentive to bandwidth considerations remember simply sending the posting to the service increases network traffic avoid posting anonymously to the regular hierarchy of usenet this is the mostly likely place to alienate readers the alt hierarchy is preferred give as much information as possible in the posting i e references etc remember that content is the only means for readers to judge the truth of the message and that any inaccuracies will tend to discredit the entire message and even future ones under the same handle be careful not to include information that will reveal your identity or enable someone to deduce it test the system by sending anonymized mail to yourself be aware of the policies of the anonymous site and respect them be prepared to forfeit your anonymity if you abuse the privilege be considerate and respectful of other s objections to anonymity hit and run anonymity should be used with utmost reservation use services that provide anonymous return addresses instead be courteous to the system operator who may have invested large amounts of time be personally risking his account or dedicating his hardware all for your convenience operators document thoroughly acceptable and unacceptable uses in an introductory file that is sent to new users have a coherent and consistent policy and stick to it state clearly what logging and monitoring is occurring describe your background interest and security measures will the general approach be totalitarian or lassaiz faire formulate a plan for problematic ethical situations and anticipate potentially intense moral quandaries and dilemmas what if a user is blackmailing someone through your service what if a user posts suicidal messages through your service remember your users trust you to protect them in the site introductory note give clear examples of situations where you will take action and what these actions will be e g warn the user limit anonymity to email or posting only revoke the account out the user contact local administrator etc describe exactly the limitations of the software and hardware address the bandwidth limitations of your site report candidly and thoroughly all bugs that have occurred work closely with users to isolate and fix bugs address all bugs noted below under in stability of anonymity document the stability of the site how long has it been running what compromises have occured why are you running it what is your commitment to it include a disclaimer in outgoing mail and messages include an address for complaints ideally appended to every outgoing item consult a lawyer about your liability be committed to the long term stability of the site be prepared to deal with complaints and hate mail addressed to you if you do not own the hardware the system runs on or are not the system adminstrator consult those who do and are be considerate of providing anonymity to various groups if possible query group readers keep a uniformity and simplicity of style in outgoing message format that can be screened effectively by kill files ensure the key text anon is somewhere in every header take precautions to ensure the security of the server from physical and network based attacks and infiltrations readers do not complain attack or discredit a poster for the sole reason that he is posting anonymously make blanket condemnations that equate anonymity with cowardice and criminality or assail anonymous traffic in general for mostly neutral reasons e g its volume is heavy or increasing react to the anonymous information unemotionally abusive posters will be encouraged further if they get irrationally irate responses sometimes the most effective response is silence notify operators if very severe abuses occur such as piracy harassment extortion etc do not complain about postings being inappropriate because they offend you personally use kill files to screen anonymous postings if you object to the idea of anonymity itself avoid the temptation to proclaim that all anonymous postings should be barred from particular groups because no possible or conceivable need exists references see e g ftp eff org pub academic anonymity this article is an excerpt from an issue of fidonews on individual privacy and the use of handles it accepts the need of a system operator to know the name of a user but suggests that the use of a handle is analogous to a request to withhold the name in a letter to the editor the article concludes with a set of guidelines for preserving the right to be anonymous how do i kill anonymous postings james thomas green jgreen zeus calpoly edu try putting this in your kill file anon h j anonymous h j this will search the headers of the messages and kill any that contain anon or anonymous in them not perfect and won t kill followups note that anonymous server operators have the capability to mask anonymous postings under which the above method will not work so far this practice is not widespread but it may become more common as a countermeasure to widespread anonymous filtering what is the history behind anonymous posting servers originally anonymous posting services were introduced for individual particularly volatile newsgroups where anonymity is almost the preferred method of communication such as talk abortion and alt sex bondage one of the first was one by dave mack started in for alt sex bondage another early one was wizvax methuen ma us run by stephanie gilgut gilgut enterprises but was disbanded due to lack of funds the system provided anonymous return addresses n kbt rain com john opalko took up the functions of this server including reinstating the anonymous alias file the group alt personals has been chewing through servers like there s no tomorrow spurred by the disappearance of wizvax and interested in researching the idea karl kleinpaste karl kleinpaste godiva nectar cs cmu edu developed his own system from scratch in six hours by this time the idea of extending the server to new more mainstream groups was starting to emerge and he explored the possibility partly at the specific request by multiple users for anonymity in other groups the intended advantage of my system was specifically to allow multiple group support with a single anon identifier across all this was arguably the single biggest deficiency of previous anon systems k kleinpaste posted a message on rec nude asking users whether an anonymous service would be welcome there and judged a consensus against it k kleinpaste introduced what he calls a fire extinguisher to squelch or plonk abusive users in response to complaints and used this in three cases nevertheless after a few months of intense traffic he was eventually overwhelmed by the abuses of his server even as restricted as it was my system was subjected to abuses to the point where it was ordered dismantled by the facilities staff here such abuses started right after it was created in nov johan helsingius julf penet fi set up the most controversial anonymous site to date anon penet fi is based on scripts and c code written by k kleinpaste and supports anonymized mail posting and return addresses he initially wanted to confine the service to scandinavian users but expanded it to worldwide accessability in response to lots of international requests j helsingius policy of allowing anonymous posting to every usenet newsgroup has been met with strong and serious ideological opposition e g by news adminstrators in news admin policy because of the relative newness and recent emergence of the medium abuses by anonymous posters tend to have higher visibility than routine abuses his total commitment to preservation of anonymity is also controversial for example in a highly controversial and publicized case in feb an anonymous user posted a supposed transcript of desperate crew dialogue during the challenger shuttle disaster via anon penet fi to sci astro despite that the transcript had been posted in the same place up to a year earlier then non anonymously and actually originated not with the poster but a new york news tabloid subsequent responses consisted largely of vociferous outrage at the poster s use of anonymity reverberating through many newsgroups the original poster using the same anonymous handle later conceded that the story seemed likely to have been fabricated suggesting the plausible possibility that the original intent was not to provoke outrage but gauge reactions on the authenticity of the story albeit crudely free of personal risk from perceived association with the item the ensuing commotion generated queries for the original article by late entering readers the anonymous user later posted deliberately offensive comments at his detractors despite piercingly irate and outraged complaints and even the vocal opposition and verbal abuse of k kleinpaste and eminent news operators j helsingius has largely avoided use of the fire extingisher and the group bouncer mechanisms that limit the scope of the service as of march the anon penet fi site is best described as inundated it has registered over users in its initial three months of operation forwards messages a day and approximately of all usenet postings are anonymized through the site the immense popularity is probably largely due to the capability for global anonymity which has allowed users to find creative uses in diverse areas not previously envisioned johan helsingius has been subject to extraordinary pressure to dismantle his server in feb at one point k kleinpaste threatened publicly to organize a sort of vigilante group of irate news operators to send out revocation commands on all messages originating from the site j helsingius has also alluded to threats of flooding the server the server has crashed several times at least once due to a saturation mailbombing through it by an anonymous user mr helsingius reports spending up to hours per day answering email requests alone associated with the service s administration in response to the serious threats he disabled global group access temporarily for one week and encouraged his users to defend the service publicly based on fast moving dialogue and creative suggestions by cypherpunks j helsingius has identified many security weaknesses and valuable new features for the service and is currently in the process of code development and testing he is planning on upgrading the ibm compatible machine to a soon to handle the voluminous load and is considering integrating a new system with very sophisticated functionality including multiple email aliases alias allocation control public key encryption etc a very sophisticated anonymous posting system was set up in dec by d clunie dclunie pax tpa com au that used cryptography in both directions to from the server for the highest degree of confidentiality seen so far however it was running on a public access account and he had to shut it down after only several weeks upon receiving requests and conditions apparently ultimately originating from nsf representatives d clunie has released the software to the public domain recently the idea of a newsgroup devoted to whistleblowing on government abuses has received wide and focused attention and group formation is currently underway in the basic scenario the group would allow people to post pseudonymously using remailers and even establish reputations based on their authentifiable digital signatures the traffic may eventually reach reporters in the mainstream news media deltorto aol com has volunteered to attack multiple aspects of this project including distributing easy to read documentation on posting anonymization and encryption see also sections on views on anonymous posting below and what is going on with anon penet fi in this document thanks to carl kleinpaste karl kleinpaste godiva nectar cs cmu edu david clunie dclunie pax tpa com au and johan helsingius julf penet fi for contributions here what is the value of anonymity kondared purccvm bitnet i think anonymous posts do help in focusing our attention on the content of one s message sure lot of anonymous posts are abusive or frivolous but in most cases these are by users who find the anon facility novel once the novelty wears off they are stopping their pranks morgan engr uky edu wes morgan i don t mind seeing the miscellaneous hatred prejudice racism those things are part of our nature however the notion of providing anonymity s shield for these ideas repulses me if they have such strong feelings why can t they put their name s on their postings quite frankly i loathe communication with people who refuse to use their names dclunie pax tpa com au david clunie many seem to question the value of anonymity but who are they to say what risks another individual should take there is no question that in this rather conservative society that we live in holding certain views making certain statements adopting a certain lifestyle are likely to result in public censure ridicule loss of status employment or even legal action given the heterogeneity of the legal jurisdictions from where the many contributors to usenet post who knows what is legal and what is not some say that anonymous posters are cowards and should stand up and be counted perhaps that is one point of view but what right do these detractors have to exercise such censorship from doug cc ysu edu doug sewell why is it censorship to not expect someone to speak for themselves without the cloak of anonymity this is at best a lame argument you tell me why what you have to say requires anonymity and you tell me why the wishes of a majority of non anonymous users of a newsgroup should be disregarded when they don t want anonymous posts anonymous users have less rights than any others they are not legitimate usenet participants i would not honor rfds cfvs control messages or votes from one brad clarinet com brad templeton i can think of no disadvantage caused by anon posting sites that doesn t already exist other than the fact that they do make more naive net users who don t know how to post anonymously the old way more prone to do it from mandel netcom com tom mandel i cannot speak for others but i regard anonymous postings in a serious discussion as pretty much worthless views that hide behind the veil of anon are hardly worth the trouble of reading n anon penet fi hank pankey since i began posting anonymously to show support for general principles of personal privacy i have been subject to far more abuse and attack than i ever received before people seem to find it easier to flame and insult someone whose name they don t know perhaps it s easier to pretend that there is no person behind the email address who feels the sting of abusive comments anonymity does hinder some methods of controlling other posters actions people who seek such control will naturally oppose it from acearl leo bsuvc bsu edu instead of making this a free er medium by allowing posters to protect themselves with anonymity simply require that all posters be prepared to discuss their sources of information and take the heat for unsubstantiated dribble this seems to be the way things are currently done xtkmg trentu ca kate gregory in misc kids there are three threads going on started by anonymous posters one was about changing jobs so as to work less hours job sharing and so on from a woman who didn t want anyone at her current place of work to know she was thinking of looking for work elsewhere the next was from a woman who is thinking of having a baby sometime soon and doesn t want coworkers friends family etc etc to know all about it but who wants advice the third is about sex after parenthood actually this was started by people posting in the usual way but then it was pointed out that the anonymous posting service might let more people participate misc kids doesn t seem to be suffering any harm from the presence of anonymous posters in fact it seems to have been helped by it hoey zogwarg etl army mil dan hoey while there has never been any real security against anonymous or forged postings on usenet the process has until now been sufficiently inconvenient error prone and undocumented to limit its use by persons who have not learned the culture of the net on the other hand a recent use of the anonymous posting service on sci math seemed seemed to be a student asking help on a homework problem it has now been attributed to a teacher asking for an explanation of a dubious answer in his teaching guide he says his news posting is broken so he is using the anonymous service as a mail to news gateway karl barrus elee sf menudo uh edu some argue that the opinions of the people who hide behind a veil of anonymity are worthless and that people should own up to their thoughts i agree with the latter point in an ideal world we would all be sitting around engaging in socratic dialogues freely exchanging our opinions in an effort to learn but in an ideal world nobody will threaten you for your thoughts or ridicule you but we live in a world where the people who don t agree with you may try to harm you let s face it some people aren t going to agree with your opinion no matter how logically you try to present it or how reasoned out it may be this is sad since it does restrict people from voicing their opinions red redpoll neoucom edu richard e depew the consensus seems to be that a general anonymous posting service such as that at anon penet fi seems sufficiently corrosive of the trust and civility of the net that this particular experiment should be ended perhaps the next time the question comes up we can say we tried it we learned it does more harm than good and we stopped it from c vm urz uni heidelberg de alexander eichener anonymous posting has not created major problems aside from angering irate people like you who would rather ban anonymous pseudonymous posting altogether because real men can stand up for what they said or comparable puerile arguments as others have brought up dave elxr jpl nasa gov dave hayes what a primal example of human nature i have three questions for you folks do people really say different things to each other based upon whether their identity is or isn t known are people really so affected by what other people say that the verbage is labeled abuse most importantly on a forum that prizes itself on the freedom of communication that it enjoys is there really such a thing as freedom of communication from terry geovision gvc com terry mcgonigal sigh just how many anon services are needed will everybody start running one soon what s the purpose who stands to benefit when there are n anon services then n then n out there where has this sudden fasination with anon services come from for better or imho worse it looks like we er gonna get stuck with these things and as much as i don t like the idea of services like this becoming the norm i don t really think there s much to be done since it s obvious that anyone who wants to can set one up with a bit of work karl kleinpaste cs cmu edu karl kleinpaste weak reasoning with freedom comes responsibility dave elxr jpl nasa gov dave hayes responsibility isn t real if it is enforced true responsibilty comes with no coercion should anonymous posting to all groups be allowed morgan engr uky edu wes morgan i will be the first to admit that i hold some controversial opinions indeed i m sure that none of us are completely orthodox in our opinions however i ve received hundreds of anonymous email messages over the last few years fewer than of them were reasonable posts made with good motives it s getting more and more difficult to remember why we need anonymity at all the abusers are once again lousing things up for those who truly need the service or those who would put it to good use i m not suggesting that we should ban anonymous servers as i ve said there are several situations in which anonymity is a good thing tm however the notion that anonymity s shield should be automatically extended to every usenet discussion is ridiculous it opens the door to further abuse twpierce unix amherst edu tim pierce of course how does one determine whether a group requests the service a flat majority of posters voting in favor a positive margin of votes or what no one speaks for a newsgroup i m not convinced by the arguments that an anonymous posting service for all newsgroups is inherently a bad idea simply because it s a diversion from the status quo since the status quo previously permitted anonymous posting to no newsgroups any anonymous posting service would reject the status quo hartman ulogic uucp richard m hartman writes it is facist to suggest that a newsgroup is best able to decide whether it wants to allow anonymous postings instead of having them forced upon them by an service administrator ogil quads uchicago edu brian w ogilvie the service provides a mechanism for forwarding mail to the original poster since most usenet readers don t know john smith from jane doe except by their opinions and their address the effect of having an anonymous posting to which mail replies can be directed is minimal except for those who personally know the poster and the lack of anonymity could be serious any mechanism like this is liable to abuse but the benefits as well as the costs must be weighed limiting the service to alt groups or specific groups would not help those who want advice on sensitive issues in more professional newsgroups from tarl sw stratus com tarl neustaedter an additional point is that some of us find anonimity in technical matters to be profoundly offensive anonimity in different forums has different meanings if i get a phone call from someone who won t identify himself i hang up if i get u s mail with no return address it goes into the garbage unopened if someone accosts me in the street while wearing a mask i back away carefully and expecting violence in a technical discussion anonimity means that the individual isn t willing to associate himself with the matter being discussed which discredits his utterances and makes listening to them a waste of time anonimity leads to fun psych experiments the literature is filled with all the various things that people will do anonymously that they won t otherwise including one notorious study involving torture that would not have passed today s ethical standards fun stuff in any case fine leave us out of it from jbuck forney berkeley edu joe buck you obviously have never submitted an article to a refereed journal where you will receive anonymous reviews through a server the editor that behaves much like the one in finland e g you may reply and the editor will maintain the anonymity your comparison of someone who wants to express him herself on a technical issue anonymously with a person who approaches you on a dark street with a ski mask is just emotionally overwrought nonsense such posters pose no physical threat to you jik mit edu j kamens it seems obvious to me that the default should be not to allow anonymous postings in a newsgroup the usenet has always operated on the principle that the status quo should be kept unless there s a large number of people who want to change it if someone really needs to post a message anonymous in a newsgroup in which this usually isn t done they can usually find someone on the net to do this for them they don t need an automated service to do it and the automated service is by its nature incapable of making the judgment call necessary to decide whether a particular posting really needs to be anonymous from twpierce unix amherst edu tim pierce for any newsgroup you name i bet i can envision a scenario involving a need for secrecy if an accurate content based filter of each anonymous posting could be devised to screen out those that don t require secrecy wonderful but it can t be done from lhp daimi aau dk lasse hiller e petersen if a newsgroup wants to be noise and nuisance free then it should call for moderation this should happen on a per newsgroup basis and not as a general usenet ban on anonymous postings of course one principle of moderation might be to keep out all anonymous postings and could be achieved automatically it would still be moderation personally i would prefer moderation criteria being based on actual content david a clunie dclunie pax tpa com au if a group doesn t want to receive certain posts it should become moderated there are clearly defined mechanisms on non alt groups for this to take place an automated moderator excluding posts from certain eg anonymous sites or individuals could easily be established if anyone wants to take such a draconian approach then they are welcome to do so and good luck to them i doubt if i will be reading their group from dave frackit uucp dave ratcliffe what possible need would someone have for posting anonymously to a sci group sure most adults are willing to post under their own names why would they want to hide behind an anonymous posting service ashamed of what they have to say or just trying to rile people without fear of being identified anonymous posting have their place in certain groups if i or anyone else needs to tell you what those groups are then you ve been on another planet breathing exotic gases for too long from karl kleinpaste cs cmu edu it s bloody fascinating that all the proponents of unimpeded universal anon posting access can t seem to find any middle ground at all why is there such a perception of absolutism where does this instant gratification syndrome come from i want anon access and i want it now who are the control freaks here from acearl leo bsuvc bsu edu remember this is a newsgroup for posters writing about scientific issues anonymous discussion of scientific issues leads to bad science from noring netcom com jon noring though many have personal philosophical arguments against anonymous posters their arguments have not been compelling enough to convince me that omni newsgroup anonymous posting should be banned or severely restricted though i cannot prove it it seems to me that those who do not like anonymous posting in principle do so for reasons that are personal read psychological discomfort rather than for reasons related to maintaining the integrity of usenet remember it is impossible to be able to ascertain all the conceivable and legitimate motives for anonymous posting to newsgroups one normally would not deem to be sensitive in general i fear even letting newsgroup readers vote on either allowing or not allowing anonymous posting since a priori they cannot know all the motives of legitimate posters and i do not believe that any system should ever be instituted that would inhibit the posting of legitimate and informative posts lestat wixer cactus org lyle j mackey writes i personally don t believe that pseudonymous postings are appropriate in a serious discussion area if there is a legitimate reason for concealing the posters identity perhaps but simply because they re not so sure if they want their name attached doesn t qualify as legitimate in my book oh and if you can come up with a legitimate purpose for anonymous postings please enlighten me sderby crick ssctr bcm tmc edu stuart p derby three of our the u s s founding fathers madison hamilton and jay seemed to think anonymous posting was ok the federalist papers were originally printed in new york newspapers with authorship attributed to publius i wonder if you would find their purpose legitimate what should system operators do with anonymous postings from emcguire intellection com ed mcguire i would like to know how to junk all articles posted by the anonymous service currently being discussed ideally i would actually tell my feed site not to feed me articles posted by the anonymous service assuming the c news performance release what is a simple way to accomplish this or where should i look to learn how to do it myself from dclunie pax tpa com au david clunie that s a bit draconian isn t it have your users unanimously decided that they would like you to do this or have you decided for them from emcguire intellection com ed mcguire good question nobody has decided i have no definite plan to do this just wanted the technical data carl kleinpaste karl kleinpaste godiva nectar cs cmu edu were i to be in the position of offering such a service again my promises of protection of anonymity would be limited not on the basis of personal opinion of what gets posted but on the basis of postings which disrupt the smooth operation of the usenet the most obvious and direct recourse would be to out the abusive individual less drastic possibilities exist the software supports a fire extinguisher by which individuals can be prevented from posting john iastate edu john hascall since when is usenet a democracy if someone wants to run an anonymous service that s their business if you want to put that host in your killfile that s your business if a newsadmin wants to blanket drop all postings from that site that s between them and the other people at that site if everyone ignores a service the service effectively doesn t exist from jik athena mit edu jonathan i kamens nntp servers that allow posting from anyone are not a service to the net they do the net a disservice terminal servers have the same problems as open nntp servers they allow people who want to do illegal immoral unethical things on the internet to do so without accountability there are by now public access sites all over this country if not all over the world that allow very inexpensive access to the usenet and the internet there is no reason for nntp servers to allow anyone to post messages through them and there is no reason for terminal servers to allow anyone to connect to them and then make outbound connections through them perhaps when it was harder to get to the internet or the usenet open servers could be justified but not now jbotz mtholyoke edu jurgen botz i think that what these points show clearly is that an anonymous posting service has a great deal of responsibility both towards its clients and towards the net as a whole such a service should imho have a set of well defined rules and a contract that its clients should sign under the terms of which they are assured anonymity from an anon penet fi is the problem that some are used to punishing posters who are upsetting in some vague way by complaining to the usually acquiescent sysadmin or organizations that the poster belongs to that surely is the most gutless approach to solving problems but my experience on the net shows that the same users who vilify anonymous postings are the first to write obsessively detailed grievances to the poster s supervisor when his or her tranquility is disturbed by some intrusive or subversive post or another anonymous postings prevent just this kind of intimidation from gandalf cyberspace org eric schilling the main point i would like to make here is that while we can go through and revise the news sw to reject anon posts to technical newsgroups or some such thing i think the attempt will prove futile each attempt to modify news can result in a changed approach by anon service providers to thwart the change i think this would be pointless from julf penet fi johan helsingius i have tried to stay out of this discussion and see where the discussion leads but now i rally feel like i have to speak up i have repeatedly made clear that i do block users if they continue their abuse after having been warned in many cases the users have taken heed of the warning and stopped and in some cases even apologized in public and when the warning has not had the desired effect i have blocked a number of users i have also blocked access to groups where the readership has taken a vote to ban anonymous postings although i feel changing the newsgroup status to moderated is the only permanent solution for newsgroups that want to formalize discussion red redpoll neoucom edu richard e depew does this mean that you are volunteering to issue a request for discussion to ban anonymous postings or to moderate each of the newsgroups that your server can reach i don t think so but this illustrates the trouble that your server is causing please listen to the consensus of the news administrators in this group any newsgroup should be consulted before letting your server post messages to that group from c vm urz uni heidelberg de alexander eichener there is no pompous consensus of the news administrators here maybe you would like to invent one there is a sizeable number of people who are concerned about the possible and to a minor extent about the actual abuse of the server as it is configured now these concerns are respectable johan is dealing with them there are some few who rage with foam before their mouth and condemn the service altogether and a number who defend it pointing out like kate gregory that even a group like misc kids can benefit from pseudonymous postings from julf penet fi johan helsingius i have answered a lot of personal mail related to server abuse and as a result of that blocked a number of abusive users i have also withdrawn the service from several newsgroups where the users have taken a vote on the issue i have not made any comments on news admin policy partly because the newly implemented password feature as a emergency measure against a security hole has kept me really busy answering user queries the last two weeks and partly because i feel it is not for me to justify the service but for the users the problem with news admin policy is that the readership is rather elective representing people whith a strong interest in centralised control from hartman ulogic uucp richard m hartman this seems to be a rather bigoted attitude i would consider that this group is for anyone who wishes to discuss how the net should be controlled saying that we only have an interest in centralized control is a clear indication of bias you are perfectly welcome to join in the discussions here to promote your views on control jbuck ohm berkeley edu this whole debate is a lot of sound and fury signifying nothing because even if you all decide to ban anonymous posting servers it is not enforceable the only people who conceivably could enforce retrictions are those that control the international links policy changes should be made by cooperation not by attempting to dictate you need to persuade those who run the services to act like this through friendly persuasion not by trying to beat them over the head with a stick especially a stick you don t even have spp zabriskie berkeley edu steve pope i am finding this bias against pseudonymity boring our friend posting through penet has a point the old guard would like to keep their network the way it always has been and this new thing these pseudonymous servers cuts into their turf so they whine and bitch about it and every time there s the slightest abuse such as somebody s sig being too long they try to parlay that into an argument against pseudonymity i ll go on record as saying three cheers for the admins at anon servers like penet pax and n kbt and for all the access service providers who are willing to preserve their clients privacy and a pox on those who try to defeat and restrict pseudonymity mimir stein u washington edu al billings i wouldn t help people get rid of anon postings as a group if you don t like what someone says then you put that anon address in your kill file not all of them of course if and when i get an anon site going i m just going to assign fake names like jsmith instead of anon to avoid most of the hassles you ll never know it is anonymous will you from anne alcor concordia ca anne bennett i must admit to some astonishment at this argument i see the value of anonymous postings under some circumstances yet believe strongly that these should be identified as such so that people who do not wish to read material from people who won t identify themselves don t have to i fail to see what good you would be accomplishing and indeed surmise that you will cause many people inconvenience and annoyance by hiding the anonymity of postings from your anonymous site would you care to justify where the hell you get the gall to try to prevent people from effectively filtering their news as they see fit from dclunie pax tpa com au david clunie i thought i was out of reach here in australia too unfortunately one of the us sites involved in the us aus feed complained to the australian academic reasearch network through whom my site is connected not about anything in particular just the concept of anonymous mail having no redeeming features and consuming a narrow bandwidth link with which i can t argue and that was that stop the service or face disconnection i consider the demise of my service to have been rather unfortunate and i wish the finnish remailer luck it is a pity that there are very few if any similar services provided with in the us i guess that s the benefit of having a constitution that guarantees one freedom of speech and a legal and political system that conspires to subvert it in the name of the public good what is going on with anon penet fi run by j helsingius from karl kleinpaste cs cmu edu funny how beating the rest of the usenet over the head with a stick is ok if it s anon penet fi and universal anon access but somehow people on the other side of the same equation not even arguing to shut it off entirely but rather just to have some control applied to the abuses that manifest themselves aren t allowed to do that i have written to johan several times in the last couple of weeks he used to reply to me quite readily after all i was the source of the software as originally delivered to him he used to be downright prompt about replying to me funny now he s being an impolite bastard who doesn t answer mail at all even when it consists of really very civil queries from julf penet fi johan helsingius in your mail you told me you sent me one or more messages on feb th feb th and th the server was down and the flood of mail that resulted from the server coming up again crashed my own mail host the problem was aggregated by an abusive user sending thousands of messages to another user filling up that users mailbox the bounce messages ended up in my mailbox overflowing my local disk as well i can only suppose that your message got lost in that hassle as i have tried to answer as much as possible of the anon related messages i get from routine mis addessed messages to complaints about the service on the average i spend hours per day answering anon related messages from karl kleinpaste cs cmu edu why is it that everybody else has to put up with the impoliteness and insensitivity of the misuse of anon penet fi whose definitions of polite and sense apply and why why is universal anon access considered to be within the realm of this fuzzy concept of politeness in the first place i think johan has long since crossed the line into being a rude bastard and i told him so in private mail a little while ago at this point i deeply regret a having created an anonymous system supporting newsgroup and b having given the code to johan i didn t copyright it but i thought that some concept of politeness and good sense might follow it to new homes interesting that johan s ideas of politeness and good sense seem to have nearly no interesection with mine i could even cope with universal anon access if johan would be willing to engage in abuse control but somehow that seems to be outside the range of reality from julf penet fi johan helsingius there is no way for me to convey how sad and upset your message made me i do to some extent understand your feelings but it still feels really bad running the server requires getting used to a lot of flames but mindlessly abusive hate mail is so much easier to deal with than something like this as i do respect and value your views and opinions to a high degree no i m not asking for sympathy i just wanted you to know that i am really giving your views quite a lot of weight when i asked for the software i was actually only going to provide the service to scandinavian users but a lot of people requested that i keep the service open to the international community i now realize that i ought to have contacted you at that point to ask how you feel about me using your stuff in such a context again i really want to apologise and i will replace the remaining few pieces of code thet still stem from your system unfortunately there is no way to remove the ideas and structure i got from you again i am really sorry that the results of your work ended up being used in a way that you don t approve of and i will be giving a lot of hard thought to the possibility of shutting down the server alltogether from karl kleinpaste cs cmu edu i think i m feeling especially rude and impolite if it s good for johan it s good for me after all he didn t ask the greater usenet whether universal anon access was a good idea he just did it yes i m a seriously rude pain in the ass now and i think i ll arm the usenet death penalty slightly modified not for strategic whole site attack but tactical assault just an anon penet fi destruction only outside alt too let s say to parrot this line people have been doing things like the udp that is cancelling others postings for years no one could ever stop them and it s only politeness and good sense that has prevented them up to now in fact i have people who have expressed privately the desire and ability to arm the udp ps no in fact there are not newsadmins ready to arm the udp it would be amusing to know how many people gulped hard when they read that though i don t see it as any different from johan s configuration pps now that i ve calmed some fears by the above ps there are newsadmins ready to arm the udp they ve asked for my code i haven t sent it yet only one site would be necessary to bring anon penet fi to a screeching halt anyone can implement the udp on their own if they care to politeness and good sense prevents them from doing so i wonder how long before one form of impoliteness brings on another form from julf penet fi johan helsingius it would be trivially easy to bring anon penet fi to a screeching halt in fact it has happened a couple of times already but as we are talking threats here let me make one as well a very simple one if somebody uses something like the udp or maliciously brings down anon penet fi by some other means it will stay down but i will let the users know why and name the person who did it ok as somebody said on this thread you have to take personal responsibility for your actions right from avs ccc amdahl com atul v salgaonkar i am very grateful and appreciative of this service courtesey of penet fi some important questions about my personal life career job were resolved due to kind help of other people who had been thru similar situations in return i have also replied to anon postings where i thought i could make a positive contribution in general anon service is a great in my opinion although like any tool some people will not use it responsibly i suggest that it should be kept alive wasting bandwidth is less important than saving lives i think from us mmm serc m com elisa j collins i have been informed that the anonymous posting service to many newsgroups has been turned off as a result

via the nist computer security bbs at the white house office of the press secretary for immediate release april statement by the press secretary the president today announced a new initiative that will bring the federal government together with industry in a voluntary program to improve the security and privacy of telephone communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement the initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links for too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting americans rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth privacy and law enforcement previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer it is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files while encryption technology can help americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information it also can be used by terrorists drug dealers and other criminals a state of the art microcircuit called the clipper chip has been developed by government engineers the chip represents a new approach to encryption technology it can be used in new relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary telephone it scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today this new technology will help companies protect proprietary information protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically at the same time this

sci.crypt	re text of white house announcement and q as on clipper chip encryption clipper csrc ncsl nist gov clipper chip announcement writes the president today announced a new initiative that will bring the federal government together with industry in a voluntary program to improve the security and privacy of telephone communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement a nice formulation for the introduction of the first encryption devices with built in trapdoors just like the feds wanted for too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting americans rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth privacy and law enforcement previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement bla bla protect electronic mail and computer files while encryption technology can help americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information it also can be used by terrorists drug dealers and other criminals indeed and the current proposal does nothing to prevent the latter an ordinary telephone it scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today this doesn t say much there are many incredibly weak encryption algorithms in commercial use today this new technology will help companies protect proprietary information protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically except from the government at the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals nope the criminals won t be stupid enough to use the new chip they ll use something secure this technology provides only means to intercept the phone conversations of people who are stupid enough to use it agencies to decode messages encoded by the device when the device is manufactured the two keys will be deposited separately in two key escrow data bases that will be established by the attorney general access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap that is the government has the keys it doesn t matter much if they are in one or in two of its hands the clipper chip technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of americans correct it does however provide those americans with the false sense of privacy devices in addition respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings if the screening is not public it cannot be trusted some people do not trust des even today after all the examinations only because some parts of its design were kept secret the chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption s dual edge sword encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry but it also can shield criminals and terrorists we need the clipper chip and other approaches that can both provide law abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities in order to assess technology so they ll use a different technology to hide their illegal activities so will those law abiding citizens who do not trust their government not to misuse its abilities to decrypt their conversations the privacy of our citizens including the need to employ voice or data encryption for business purposes except from the government the need of u s companies to manufacture and export high technology products huh later it says that the new technology will be export restricted since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure the federal government must act quickly to develop consistent comprehensive policies regarding its use the administration is committed to policies that protect all americans right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law in short the new technology can protect the law abiding citizen s privacy from the casual snooper it cannot protect him from the government if it decides to misuse its ability to decrypt the conversations protect him from the criminals who succeed to break the new encryption scheme or to steal the keys or to bribe the people who handle them etc prevent the criminals from using secure encryption for communication q does this approach expand the authority of government agencies to listen in on phone conversations a no clipper chip technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of americans correct however it does not provide them that much privacy as it claims q who will run the key escrow data banks a the two key escrow data banks will be run by two independent entities at this point the department of justice and the administration have yet to determine which agencies will oversee the key escrow data banks two candidates the nsa and the mafia q how strong is the security in the device how can i be sure how strong the security is a this system is more secure than many other voice encryption systems readily available today that is trust us while the algorithm will remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow security through obscurity system we are willing to invite an independent panel of cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all potential users that there are no unrecognized vulnerabilities if it s not entirely open to public examination it cannot be trusted besides who can prove that the devices used for examination and the ones built into your phones will be the same q whose decision was it to propose this product a the national security council the justice department the the nsa and the fbi q who was consulted the congress industry a we have on going discussions with congress and industry on encryption issues and expect those discussions to intensify as we carry out our review of encryption policy we have briefed members of congress and industry leaders on the decisions related to this initiative why did they forget the academia q will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers a the government designed and developed the key access encryption microcircuits but it is not providing the microcircuits to product manufacturers product manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip manufacturer that produces them doesn t this smell to monopolism q who provides the clipper chip a mykotronx programs it at their facility in torrance california and will sell the chip to encryption device manufacturers the programming function could be licensed to other vendors in the future like the mafia q if the administration were unable to find a technological solution like the one proposed would the administration be willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more powerful encryption devices this is the main question why was it buried at the end a this is a fundamental policy question which will be considered during the broad policy review the key escrow we ll see mechanism will provide americans with an encryption product that is more secure more convenient and less expensive than others readily available today but it is just one trust us the administration is not saying since encryption threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement we will prohibit it outright as some countries have in short if we decide to outlaw strong crypto we ll tell you effectively done nor is the u s saying that every american as a matter of right is entitled to an unbreakable commercial encryption product there is a since the us government seems to consider strong crypto as munitions and since the us constitutions guarantees the right to every american to bear arms why is not every american entitled as a matter of right to an unbreakable commercial encryption product a it indicates that we understand the importance of encryption technology in telecommunications and computing and are committed to working with industry and public interest groups to find innovative ways to protect americans privacy help businesses to compete and ensure that law enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime and terrorism bullshit the proposed technology provides a false sense of security encryption devices with built in capabilities for breaking the encryption does not prevent the criminals to use strong crypto and is a step to outlaw strong crypto q will the devices be exportable will other devices that use the government hardware a voice encryption devices are subject to export control requirements case by case review for each export is required to ensure appropriate use of these devices the who was the optimist who believed that the new administration will leave the export controls on strong crypto devices ok i m not american it s not my

of standards and technology questions and answers about the clinton administration s telecommunications initiative q does this approach expand the authority of government agencies to listen in on phone conversations a no clipper chip technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of americans q suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation encrypted using the device what would they have to do to decipher the message a they would have to obtain legal authorization normally a court order to do the wiretap in the first place they would then present documentation of this authorization to the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug smugglers the key is split into two parts which are stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key escrow system q who will run the key escrow data banks a the two key escrow data banks will be run by two independent entities at this point the department of justice and the administration have yet to determine which agencies will oversee the key escrow data banks q how strong is the security in the device how can i be sure how strong the security is a this system is more secure than many other voice encryption systems readily available today while the algorithm will remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow system we are willing to invite an independent panel of cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all potential users that there are no unrecognized vulnerabilities q whose decision was it to propose this product a the national security council the justice department the commerce department and other key agencies were involved in this decision this approach has been endorsed by the president the vice president and appropriate cabinet officials q who was consulted the congress industry a we have on going discussions with congress and industry on encryption issues and expect those discussions to intensify as we carry out our review of encryption policy we have briefed members of congress and industry leaders on the decisions related to this initiative q will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers a the government designed and developed the key access encryption microcircuits but it is not providing the microcircuits to product manufacturers product manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip manufacturer that produces them q who provides the clipper chip a mykotronx programs it at their facility in torrance california and will sell the chip to encryption device manufacturers the programming function could be licensed to other vendors in the future q how do i buy one of these encryption devices a we expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating the clipper chip into their devices q if the administration were unable to find a technological solution like the one proposed would the administration be willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more powerful encryption devices a this is a fundamental policy question which will be considered during the broad policy review the key escrow mechanism will provide americans with an encryption product that is more secure more convenient and less expensive than others readily available today but it is just one piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to encryption technology which the administration is developing the administration is not saying since encryption threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement we will prohibit it outright as some countries have effectively done nor is the u s saying that every american as a matter of right is entitled to an unbreakable commercial encryption product there is a false tension created in the assessment that this issue is an either or proposition rather both concerns can be and in fact are harmoniously balanced through a reasoned balanced approach such as is proposed with the clipper chip and similar encryption techniques q what does this decision indicate about how the clinton administration s policy toward encryption will differ from that of the bush administration a it indicates that we understand the importance of encryption technology in telecommunications and computing and are committed to working with industry and public interest groups to find innovative ways to protect americans privacy help businesses to compete and ensure that law enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime and terrorism q will the devices be exportable will other devices that use the government hardware a voice encryption devices are subject to export control requirements case by case review for each export is required to ensure appropriate use of these devices the same is true for other encryption devices one of the attractions of this technology is the protection it can give to u s companies operating at home and abroad with this in mind we expect export licenses will be granted on a case by case basis for u s companies seeking to use these devices to secure their own communications abroad we plan to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability of these products

sci.crypt	re inventing crypto policy an eff statement april initial eff analysis of clinton privacy and security proposal the clinton administration today made a major announcement on cryptography policy which will effect the privacy and security of millions of americans the first part of the plan is to begin a comprehensive inquiry into major communications privacy issues such as export controls which have effectively denied most people easy access to robust encryption and law enforcement issues posed by new technology however eff is very concerned that the administration has already reached a conclusion on one critical part of the inquiry before any public comment or discussion has been allowed apparently the administration is going to use its leverage to get all telephone equipment vendors to adopt a voice encryption standard developed by the national security agency the so called clipper chip is an bit split key escrowed encryption scheme which will be built into chips manufactured by a military contractor two separate escrow agents would store users keys and be required to turn them over law enforcement upon presentation of a valid warrant the encryption scheme used is to be classified but the chips will be available to any manufacturer for incorporation into its communications products this proposal raises a number of serious concerns first the administration has adopted a solution before conducting an inquiry the nsa developed clipper chip may not be the most secure product other vendors or developers may have better schemes furthermore we should not rely on the government as the sole source for the clipper or any other chips rather independent chip manufacturers should be able to produce chipsets based on open standards second an algorithm cannot be trusted unless it can be tested yet the administration proposes to keep the chip algorithm classified eff believes that any standard adopted ought to be public and open the public will only have confidence in the security of a standard that is open to independent expert scrutiny third while the use of the use of a split key dual escrowed system may prove to be a reasonable balance between privacy and law enforcement needs the details of this scheme must be explored publicly before it is adopted what will give people confidence in the safety of their keys does disclosure of keys to a third party waive an individual s fifth amendment rights in subsequent criminal inquiries these are but a few of the many questions the administrations proposal raised but fails to answer in sum the administration has shown great sensitivity to the importance of these issues by planning a comprehensive inquiry into digital privacy and security however the clipper chip solution ought to be considered as part of the inquiry and not be adopted before the discussion even begins details of the proposal escrow the bit key will be divided between two escrow agents each of whom hold bits of each key the manufacturer of the communications device would be required to register all keys with the two independent escrow agents a key is tied to the device however not the person using it upon presentation of a valid court order the two escrow agents would have to turn the key parts over to law enforcement agents according to the presidential directive just issued the attorney general will be asked to identify appropriate escrow agents some in the administration have suggested that one non law enforcement federal agency perhaps the federal reserve and one non governmental organization could be chosen but there is no agreement on the identity of the agents yet classified algorithm and the possibility of back doors the administration claims that there are no back doors means by which the government or others could break the code without securing keys from the escrow agents and that the president will be told there are no back doors to this classified algorithm in order to prove this administration sources are interested in arranging for an all star crypto cracker team to come in under a security arrangement and examine the algorithm for trap doors the results of the investigation would then be made public the clipper chipset was designed and is being produced and a sole source secret contract between the national security agency and two private firms vlsi and mycotronx nsa work on this plan has been underway for about four years the manufacturing contract was let months ago government as market driver in order to get a market moving and to show that the government believes in the security of this system the feds will be the first big customers for this product users will include the fbi secret service vp al gore and maybe even the president at today

security or freedom from trap doors comprehensive policy inquiry the administration has also announced that it is about to commence an inquiry into all policy issues related to privacy protection encryption and law enforcement the items to be considered include export controls on encryption technology and the fbi s digital telephony proposal it appears that the this inquiry will be conducted

pub nistnews and via the nist computer security bbs at the white house office of the press secretary for immediate release april statement by the press secretary the president today announced a new initiative that will bring the federal government together with industry in a voluntary program to improve the security and privacy of telephone communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement the initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links for too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting americans rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth privacy and law enforcement previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer it is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files while encryption technology can help americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information it also can be used by terrorists drug dealers and other criminals a state of the art microcircuit called the clipper chip has been developed by government engineers the chip represents a new approach to encryption technology it can be used in new relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary telephone it scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today this new technology will help companies protect proprietary information protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically at the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals a key escrow system will be established to ensure that the clipper chip is used to protect the privacy of law abiding americans each device containing the chip will have two unique keys numbers that will be needed by authorized government agencies to decode messages encoded by the device when the device is manufactured the two keys will be deposited separately in two key escrow data bases that will be established by the attorney general access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap the clipper chip technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of americans to demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology the attorney general will soon purchase several thousand of the new devices in addition respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings the chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption s dual edge sword encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry but it also can shield criminals and terrorists we need the clipper chip and other approaches that can both provide law abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities in order to assess technology trends and explore new approaches like the key escrow system the president has directed government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates the privacy of our citizens including the need to employ voice or data encryption for business purposes the ability of authorized officials to access telephone calls and data under proper court or other legal order when necessary to protect our citizens the effective and timely use of the most modern technology to build the national information infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and the competitiveness of american industry in the global marketplace and the need of u s companies to manufacture and export high technology products the president has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries the congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed the administration is committed to working with the private sector to spur the development of a national information infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies to give americans unprecedented access to information this infrastructure of high speed networks information superhighways will transmit video images hdtv programming and huge data files as easily as today s telephone system transmits voice since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure the federal government must act quickly to develop consistent comprehensive policies regarding its use the administration is committed to policies that protect all americans right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet the provisions of the president s directive to acquire the new encryption technology are also available for additional details call mat heyman national institute of standards and technology questions and answers about the clinton administration s telecommunications initiative q does this approach expand the authority of government agencies to listen in on phone conversations a no clipper chip technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of americans q suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation encrypted using the device what would they have to do to decipher the message a they would have to obtain legal authorization normally a court order to do the wiretap in the first place they would then present documentation of this authorization to the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug smugglers the key is split into two parts which are stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key escrow system q who will run the key escrow data banks a the two key escrow data banks will be run by two independent entities at this point the department of justice and the administration have yet to determine which agencies will oversee the key escrow data banks q how strong is the security in the device how can i be sure how strong the security is a this system is more secure than many other voice encryption systems readily available today while the algorithm will remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow system we are willing to invite an independent panel of cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all potential users that there are no unrecognized vulnerabilities q whose decision was it to propose this product a the national security council the justice department the commerce department and other key agencies were involved in this decision this approach has been endorsed by the president the vice president and appropriate cabinet officials q who was consulted the congress industry a we have on going discussions with congress and industry on encryption issues and expect those discussions to intensify as we carry out our review of encryption policy we have briefed members of congress and industry leaders on the decisions related to this initiative q will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers a the government designed and developed the key access encryption microcircuits but it is not providing the microcircuits to product manufacturers product manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip manufacturer that produces them q who provides the clipper chip a mykotronx programs it at their facility in torrance california and will sell the chip to encryption device manufacturers the programming function could be licensed to other vendors in the future q how do i buy one of these encryption devices a we expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating the clipper chip into their devices q if the administration were unable to find a technological solution like the one proposed would the administration be willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more powerful encryption devices a this is a fundamental policy question which will be considered during the broad policy review the key escrow mechanism will provide americans with an encryption product that is more secure more convenient and less expensive than others readily available today but it is just one piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to encryption technology which the administration is developing the administration is not saying since encryption threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement we will prohibit it outright as some countries have effectively done nor is the u s saying that every american as a matter of right is entitled to an unbreakable commercial encryption product there is a false tension created in the assessment that this issue is an either or proposition rather both concerns can be and in fact are harmoniously balanced through a reasoned balanced approach such as is proposed with the clipper chip and similar encryption techniques q what does this decision indicate about how the clinton administration s policy toward encryption will differ from that of the bush administration a it indicates that we understand the importance of encryption technology in telecommunications and computing and are committed to working with industry and public interest groups to find innovative ways to protect americans privacy help businesses to compete and ensure that law enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime and terrorism q will the devices be exportable will other devices that use the government hardware a voice encryption devices are subject to export control requirements case by case review for each export is required to ensure appropriate use of these devices the same is true for other encryption devices one of the attractions of this technology is the protection it can give to u s companies operating at home and abroad with this in mind we expect export licenses will be granted on a case by case basis for u s companies seeking to use these devices to secure their own communications abroad we plan to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability of these products

sci.crypt	an open letter to mr clinton i m quite astonished shocked and appalled at this serious frontal assault on emerging american freedoms the clinton administration nor any other government agency has any legitimate role whatsoever in regulating cryptography to do so is tantamount to regulating acceptable speech and is blatantly unconstitutional perhaps we should rename this year in honor of such an illustrious proposal let the crappy chip live in infamy and the adminstration receive great shame and discredit for this bizarre misadventure i am outraged that my tax money is being used to develop technology to restrict my freedoms far beyond reasonable measures the u s government will have my full uncooperation and disobedience on any serious threat to my liberties such as this and i call on everyone with an interest in a sensible government to resist and defy this proposal the administration does not seem to understand that they are merely a subservient instrument to implement the will of the public and hence anyone involved in this proposal in this respect is wholly negligent and remiss in performing their lawful duty while encryption technology can help americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information it also can be used by terrorists drug dealers and other criminals it seems to me that u s diplomatic communications should be tappable by the u n whenever any countries produce a warrant to the u n in fact i think we should stop paying the nsa billions of dollars a year to produce unbreakable codes for this reason these actions violate the sovereignity of international law i hope mr clinton is shrewd enough to recognize my sarcasm and satire here but if he isn t it s a modest and reasonable proposal so he should find merit with it nevertheless cryptography is neutral technology if everybody has strong cryptography including policemen bureacrats businessmen housewives thugs and hoodlums we have a sustainable equilibrium anything less is an unworkable anti egaltarian arrangement intrinsically antithetical to american freedoms and guaranteed to collapse under its own weight of inherent impracticality we don t need to compromise on issues of freedom for too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting americans for too long our government has demonstrated itself to be increasingly hostile and a serious obstacle to economic vitality and protecting americans since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure the federal government must act quickly to develop consistent comprehensive policies regarding its use the administration is committed to policies that protect all americans right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law it is not possible for the federal government to act quickly or develop consistent comprehensive policies period and even if by some grandiose miracle such a thing were possible it would only be an efficient way to deprive american citizens of fundamental and inalienable rights the administration has to be committed to leaving private industries alone esp on this issue the government has no legitimate role in regulating the content of communications law enforcement agencies must be prepared to forfeit their surveillance bludgeon they are soon and inevitably to be disarmed of it q if the administration were unable to find a technological solution like the one proposed would the administration be willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more powerful encryption devices no such laws can be constitutionally sound and this is equivalent to a veiled threat which i don t appreciate this kind of extortion tends to agitate me and others into radicalism i will trade threats for threats and violation for violation the administration is not saying since encryption threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement we will prohibit it outright as some countries have effectively done if the administration did say this it would find itself impeached for reckless and outrageous disregard of essential established entrenched and explicit constitutional privacy guarantees the administration would have no legal standing whatsoever such an action would be egregiously illegal and criminal and wholly untolerated and disregarded by vast segments of the population nor is the u s saying that every american as a matter of right is entitled to an unbreakable commercial encryption product the u s comprised of a vast majority of people fanatically committed to preserving their privacy in the face of an increasingly totalitarian government is saying just that take your chips and give them to nsa employees as christmas bonuses we can run any algorithm on our computers we damn well please and we will make any chips we please and we will send any bit pattern over our data highways we please and if you try to stop us you will be gradually or abruptly dissolved into nothingness privacy vs law enforcement there is a false tension created in the assessment that this issue is an either or proposition this is an outright dingaling denning lie the two aims of privacy and surveillance are intrinsically and fundamentally incompatible and you have to work for the nsa to think otherwise americans are about to discover ways through the use of technology to preserve their inalienable but forgotten freedoms that have slowly been eroded away by an increasingly distant and unresponsive and unrepresentative government ld longs lance colostate edu

sci answers and news answers every days contents in mathematical terms what is a private key cryptosystem what is an attack what s the advantage of formulating all this mathematically why is the one time pad secure what s a ciphertext only attack what s a known plaintext attack what s a chosen plaintext attack in mathematical terms what can you say about brute force attacks what s a key guessing attack what s entropy in mathematical terms what is a private key cryptosystem a private key cryptosystem consists of an encryption system e and a decryption system d the encryption system e is a collection of functions e k indexed by keys k mapping some set of plaintexts p to some set of ciphertexts c similarly the decryption system d is a collection of functions d k such that d k e k p p for every plaintext p that is succesful decryption of ciphertext into plaintext is accomplished using the same key index as was used for the corresponding encryption of plaintext into ciphertext such systems wherein the same key value is used to encrypt and decrypt are also known as symmetric cryptoystems what is an attack in intuitive terms a passive attack on a cryptosystem is any method of starting with some information about plaintexts and their corresponding ciphertexts under some unknown key and figuring out more information about the plaintexts it s possible to state mathematically what this means here we go fix functions f g and h of n variables fix an encryption system e and fix a distribution of plaintexts and keys an attack on e using g assuming f giving h with probability p is an algorithm a with a pair f g of inputs and one output h such that there is probability p of computing h h p p n if we have f f p p n and g g e k p e k p n note that this probability depends on the distribution of the vector k p p n the attack is trivial or pointless if there is probability at least p of computing h h p p n if f f p p n and g g c c n here c c n range uniformly over the possible ciphertexts and have no particular relation to p p n in other words an attack is trivial if it doesn t actually use the encryptions e k p e k p n an attack is called one ciphertext if n two ciphertext if n and so on what s the advantage of formulating all this mathematically in basic cryptology you can never prove that a cryptosystem is secure read part we keep saying a strong cryptosystem must have this property but having this property is no guarantee that a cryptosystem is strong in contrast the purpose of mathematical cryptology is to precisely formulate and if possible prove the statement that a cryptosystem is strong we say for example that a cryptosystem is secure against all passive attacks if any nontrivial attack against the system as defined above is too slow to be practical if we can prove this statement then we have confidence that our cryptosystem will resist any passive cryptanalytic technique if we can reduce this statement to some well known unsolved problem then we still have confidence that the cryptosystem isn t easy to break other parts of cryptology are also amenable to mathematical definition again the point is to explicitly identify what assumptions we re making and prove that they produce the desired results we can figure out what it means for a particular cryptosystem to be used properly it just means that the assumptions are valid the same methodology is useful for cryptanalysis too the cryptanalyst can take advantage of incorrect assumptions often he can try to construct a proof of security for a system see where the proof fails and use these failures as the starting points for his analysis why is the one time pad secure by definition the one time pad is a cryptosystem where the plaintexts ciphertexts and keys are all strings say byte strings of some length m and e k p is just the sum let s say the exclusive or of k and p it is easy to prove mathematically that there are no nontrivial single ciphertext attacks on the one time pad assuming a uniform distribution of keys note that we don t have to assume a uniform distribution of plaintexts here s the proof let a be an attack i e an algorithm taking two inputs f g and producing one output h with some probability p that h h p whenever f f p and g g e k p i e g g k p then because the distribution of k is uniform and independent of p the distribution of k p must also be uniform and independent of p but also the distribution of c is uniform and independent of p hence there is probability exactly p that h h p whenever f f p and g g c over all p and c thus a fortiori a is trivial on the other hand the one time pad is not secure if a key k is used for more than one plaintext i e there are nontrivial multiple ciphertext attacks so to be properly used a key k must be thrown away after one encryption the key is also called a pad this explains the name one time pad what s a ciphertext only attack in the notation above a ciphertext only attack is one where f is constant given only some information g e k p e k p n about n ciphertexts the attack has to have some chance of producing some information h p p n about the plaintexts the attack is trivial if it has just as good a chance of producing h p p n when given g c c n for random c c n for example say g c c and say h p is the first bit of p we can easily write down an attack the guessing attack which simply guesses that h p is this attack is trivial because it doesn t use the ciphertext it has a fifty fifty chance of guessing correctly no matter what on the other hand there is an attack on rsa which produces one bit of information about p with success using c if it is fed a random c then the success rate drops to so this is a nontrivial attack what s a known plaintext attack the classic known plaintext attack has f p p p g c c c c and h p p depending only on p in other words given two ciphertexts c and c and one decryption p the known plaintext attack should produce information about the other decryption p note that known plaintext attacks are often defined in the literature as producing information about the key but this is pointless the cryptanalyst generally cares about the key only insofar as it lets him decrypt further messages what s a chosen plaintext attack a chosen plaintext attack is the first of an increasingly impractical series of active attacks on a cryptosystem attacks where the cryptanalyst feeds data to the encryptor these attacks don t fit into our model of passive attacks explained above anyway a chosen plaintext attack lets the cryptanalyst choose a plaintext and look at the corresponding ciphertext then repeat until he has figured out how to decrypt any message more absurd examples of this sort of attack are the chosen key attack and chosen system attack a much more important form of active attack is a message corruption attack where the attacker tries to change the ciphertext in such a way as to make a useful change in the plaintext there are many easy ways to throw kinks into all of these attacks for instance automatically encrypting any plaintext p as t e k h t r p r p where t is a time key sequence number chosen anew for each message r is a random number and h is a one way hash function here comma means concatenation and plus means exclusive or in mathematical terms what can you say about brute force attacks consider the following known plaintext attack we are given some plaintexts p p n and ciphertexts c c n we re also given a ciphertext c n we run through every key k when we find k such that e k p i c i for every i n we print d k c n if n is big enough that only one key works this attack will succeed on valid inputs all the time while it will produce correct results only once in a blue moon for random inputs thus this is a nontrivial attack its only problem is that it is very slow if there are many possible keys what s a key guessing attack what s entropy say somebody is using the one time pad but isn t choosing keys randomly and uniformly from all m bit messages as he was supposed to for our security proof in fact say he s known to prefer keys which are english words then a cryptanalyst can run through all english words as possible keys this attack will often succeed and it s much faster than a brute force search of the entire keyspace we can measure how bad a key distribution is by calculating its entropy this number e is the number of real bits of information of the key a cryptanalyst will typically happen across the key within e guesses e is defined as the sum of p k log p k where p k is the probability of key k

encryption has been shown to be very easy to break the method uses xor with two repeating key streams a typed password and a byte wide counter initialized to the password length full descriptions are given in bennett ben and bergen and caelli ber chris galas writes someone awhile back was looking for a way to decrypt wordperfect document files and i think i have a solution there is a software company named accessdata east south orem ut that has a software package that will decrypt any wordperfect lotus quatro pro ms excel and paradox files the cost of the package is steep prices but if you think your pw key is less than characters or char give them a call and ask for the free demo disk the demo disk will decrypt files that have a char or less pw key how do i break a vigenere repeated key cipher a repeated key cipher where the ciphertext is something like the plaintext xor keykeykeykey and so on is called a vigenere cipher if the key is not too long and the plaintext is in english do the following discover the length of the key by counting coincidences see gaines gai sinkov sin trying each displacement of the ciphertext against itself count those bytes which are equal if the two ciphertext portions have used the same key something over of the bytes will be equal if they have used different key then less than will be equal assuming random bit bytes of key covering normal ascii text the smallest displacement which indicates an equal key is the length of the repeated key shift the text by that length and xor it with itself this removes the key and leaves you with text xored with itself since english has about bit of real information per byte streams of text xored together has bits of info per bit byte providing plenty of redundancy for choosing a unique decryption and in fact one stream of text xored with itself has just bit per byte if the key is short it might be even easier to treat this as a standard polyalphabetic substitution all the old cryptanalysis texts show how to break those it s possible with those methods in the hands of an expert if there s only ten times as much text as key see for example gaines gai sinkov sin how do i send encrypted

privacy enhanced mail it is described in rfcs through to join the pem mailing list contact pem dev request tis com there is a beta version of pem being tested at the time of this writing there are also two programs available in the public domain for encrypting mail pgp and ripem both are available by ftp each has its own newsgroup alt security pgp and alt security ripem each has its own faq as well pgp is most commonly used outside the usa since it uses the rsa algorithm without a license and rsa s patent is valid only or at least primarily in the usa ripem is most commonly used inside the usa since it uses the rsaref which is freely available within the usa but not available for shipment outside the usa since both programs use a secret key algorithm for encrypting the body of the message pgp used idea ripem uses des and rsa for encrypting the message key they should be able to interoperate freely although there have been repeated calls for each to understand the other s formats and algorithm choices no interoperation is available at this time as far as we know is the unix crypt command secure no see ree there is a program available called cbw crypt breaker s workbench which can be used to do ciphertext only attacks on files encrypted with crypt one source for cbw is ftpcb how do i use compression with encryption a number of people have proposed doing perfect compression followed by some simple encryption method e g xor with a repeated key unfortunately you can only compress perfectly if you know the exact distribution of possible inputs for all practical purposes it s impossible to describe the typical english text beyond coarse characteristics such as single letter frequencies you can build up more and more sophisticated models of your inputs but if the enemy has a slightly more accurate model he ll be able to find some redundancy in your compressed output note that nearly all practical compression schemes unless they have been designed with cryptography in mind produce output that actually starts off with high redundancy for example the output of unix compress begins with a well known three byte magic number that can serve as an entering wedge for cryptanalysis this is not to say that compression before encryption is inherently a bad idea it just has to be done very very carefully and by no means removes the need for strong encryption compression after encryption is silly is there an unbreakable cipher yes the one time pad is unbreakable see part unfortunately the one time pad requires secure distribution of as much key material as plaintext of course a cryptosystem need not be utterly unbreakable to be useful rather it needs to be strong enough to resist attacks by likely enemies for whatever length of time the data it protects is expected to remain valid what does random mean in cryptography cryptographic applications demand much more out of a pseudorandom number generator than most applications for a source of bits to be cryptographically random it must be computationally impossible to predict what the nth random bit will be given complete knowledge of the algorithm or hardware generating the stream and the sequence of th through n st bits for all n up to the lifetime of the source a software generator also known as pseudo random has the function of expanding a truly random seed to a longer string of apparently random bits this seed must be large enough not to be guessed by the opponent ideally it should also be truly random perhaps generated by a hardware random number source those who have sparcstation workstations could for example generate random numbers using the audio input device as a source of entropy by not connecting anything to it for example cat dev audio compress foo gives a file of high entropy not random but with much randomness in it one can then encrypt that file using part of itself as a key for example to convert that seed entropy into a pseudo random string when looking for hardware devices to provide this entropy it is important really to measure the entropy rather than just assume that because it looks complicated to a human it must be random for example disk operation completion times sound like they might be unpredictable to many people but a spinning disk is much like a clock and its output completion times are relatively low in entropy what is the unicity point a k a unicity distance see sha the unicity distance is an approximation to that amount of ciphertext such that the sum of the real information entropy in the corresponding source text and encryption key equals the number of ciphertext bits used ciphertexts significantly longer than this can be shown probably to have a unique decipherment this is used to back up a claim of the validity of a ciphertext only cryptanalysis ciphertexts significantly shorter than this are likely to have multiple equally valid decryptions and therefore to gain security from the opponent s difficulty choosing the correct one unicity distance like all statistical or information theoretic measures does not make deterministic predictions but rather gives probabilistic results namely the minimum amount of ciphertext for which it is likely that there is only a single intelligible plaintext corresponding to the ciphertext when all possible keys are tried for the decryption working cryptologists don t normally deal with unicity distance as such instead they directly determine the likelihood of events of interest let the unicity distance of a cipher be d characters if fewer than d ciphertext characters have been intercepted then there is not enough information to distinguish the real key from a set of possible keys des has a unicity distance of characters which is less than ciphertext blocks each block corresponds to ascii characters this may seem alarmingly low at first but the unicity distance gives no indication of the computational work required to find the key after approximately d characters have been intercepted in fact actual cryptanalysis seldom proceeds along the lines used in discussing unicity distance like other measures such as key size unicity distance is something that guarantees insecurity if it s too small but doesn t guarantee security if it s high few practical cryptosystems are absolutely impervious to analysis all manner of characteristics might serve as entering wedges to crack some cipher messages however similar information theoretic considerations are occasionally useful for example to determine a recommended key change interval for a particular cryptosystem cryptanalysts also employ a variety of statistical and information theoretic tests to help guide the analysis in the most promising directions unfortunately most literature on the application of information statistics to cryptanalysis remains classified even the seminal work of alan turing see koz for some insight into the possibilities see kul and goo what is key management and why is it important one of the fundamental axioms of cryptography is that the enemy is in full possession of the details of the general cryptographic system and lacks only the specific key data employed in the encryption of course one would assume that the cia does not make a habit of telling mossad about its cryptosystems but mossad probably finds out anyway repeated use of a finite amount of key provides redundancy that can eventually facilitate cryptanalytic progress thus especially in modern communication systems where vast amounts of information are transferred both parties must have not only a sound cryptosystem but also enough key material to cover the traffic key management refers to the distribution authentication and handling of keys a publicly accessible example of modern key management technology is the stu iii secure telephone unit which for classified use employs individual coded crypto ignition keys and a central key management center operated by nsa there is a hierarchy in that certain ciks are used by authorized cryptographic control personnel to validate the issuance of individual traffic keys and to perform installation maintenance functions such as the reporting of lost ciks this should give an inkling of the extent of the key management problem for public key systems there are several related issues many having to do with whom do you trust can i use pseudo random or chaotic numbers as a key stream chaotic equations and fractals produce an apparent randomness from relatively compact generators perhaps the simplest example is a linear congruential sequence one of the most popular types of random number generators where there is no obvious dependence between seeds and outputs unfortunately the graph of any such sequence will in a high enough dimension show up as a regular lattice mathematically this lattice corresponds to structure which is notoriously easy for cryptanalysts to exploit more complicated generators have more complicated structure which is why they make interesting pictures but a cryptographically strong sequence will have no computable structure at all see knu exercise ree and boy what is the correct frequency list for english letters there are three answers to this question each slightly deeper than the one before you can find the first answer in various books namely a frequency list computed directly from a certain sample of english text of course any such list will be correctly computed but exactly which list you get depends on which sample was taken the second answer is that the question doesn t make sense what do you mean by english letters the english language is not a fixed finite closed object that can be exactly characterized it has changed over time it is different between different authors any particular message will have different statistics from those of the language as a whole the third answer is that yes no particular message is going to have exactly the same characteristics as english in general but for all reasonable statistical uses these slight discrepancies won t matter in fact there s an entire field called bayesian statistics other buzzwords are maximum entropy methods and maximum likelihood estimation which studies questions like what s the chance that a text with these letter frequencies is in english and comes up with reasonably robust answers so make your own list from your own samples of english text it will be good enough for practical work if you use it properly what is the enigma for a project in data security we are looking for sources of information about the german enigma code and how it was broken by the british during wwii see wel dea koz hod kah how do i shuffle cards card shuffling is a special case of the permutation of an array of values using a random or pseudo random function all possible output permutations of this process should be equally likely to do this you need a random function modran x which will produce a uniformly distributed random integer in the interval x given that function you can shuffle with the following c code assuming arrlth is the length of array arr and swap interchanges values at the two addresses given for n arrlth n n swap arr modran n arr n modran x can not be achieved exactly with a simple ranno x since ranno s interval may not be divisible by x although in most cases the error will be very small to cover this case one can take ranno s modulus mod x call that number y and if ranno returns a value less than y go back and get another ranno value can i foil s w pirates by encrypting my cd rom someone will frequently express the desire to publish a cd rom with possibly multiple pieces of software perhaps with each encrypted separately and will want to use different keys for each user perhaps even good for only a limited period of time in order to avoid piracy as far as we know this is impossible since there is nothing in standard pc or workstation hardware which uniquely identifies the user at the keyboard if there were such an identification then the cd rom could be encrypted with a key based in part on the one sold to the user and in part on the unique identifier however in this case the cd rom is one of a kind and that defeats the intended purpose if the cd rom is to be encrypted once and then mass produced there must be a key or set of keys for that encryption produced at some stage in the process that key is useable with any copy of the cd rom s data the pirate needs only to isolate that key and sell it along with the illegal copy can you do automatic cryptanalysis of simple ciphers schneier chinet chi il us bruce schneier says accessdata of orem utah sells

is a brute force search and what is its cryptographic relevance what are some properties satisfied by every strong cryptosystem if a cryptosystem is theoretically unbreakable then is it guaranteed analysis proof in practice why are many people still using cryptosystems that are relatively easy to break what is cryptology cryptography plaintext ciphertext encryption key the story begins when julius caesar sent messages to his trusted acquaintances he didn t trust the messengers so he replaced every a by a c every b by a d and so on through the alphabet only someone who knew the shift by rule could decipher his messages a cryptosystem or cipher system is a method of disguising messages so that only certain people can see through the disguise cryptography is the art of creating and using cryptosystems cryptanalysis is the art of breaking cryptosystems seeing through the disguise even when you re not supposed to be able to cryptology is the study of both cryptography and cryptanalysis the original message is called a plaintext the disguised message is called a ciphertext encryption means any procedure to convert plaintext into ciphertext decryption means any procedure to convert ciphertext into plaintext a cryptosystem is usually a whole collection of algorithms the algorithms are labelled the labels are called keys for instance caesar probably used shift by n encryption for several different values of n it s natural to say that n is the key here the people who are supposed to be able to see through the disguise are called recipients other people are enemies opponents interlopers eavesdroppers or third parties what references can i start with to learn cryptology for an introduction to technical matter the survey articles given in part are the best place to begin as they are in general concise authored by competent people and well written however these articles are mostly concerned with cryptology as it has developed in the last years or so and are more abstract and mathematical than historical the codebreakers by kahn kah is encyclopedic in its history and technical detail of cryptology up to the mid s introductory cryptanalysis can be learned from gaines gai or sinkov sin this is recommended especially for people who want to devise their own encryption algorithms since it is a common mistake to try to make a system before knowing how to break one the selection of an algorithm for the des drew the attention of many public researchers to problems in cryptology consequently several textbooks and books to serve as texts have appeared the book of denning den gives a good introduction to a broad range of security including encryption algorithms database security access control and formal models of security similar comments apply to the books of price davies pri and pfleeger pfl the books of konheim kon and meyer matyas mey are quite technical books both konheim and meyer were directly involved in the development of des and both books give a thorough analysis of des konheim s book is quite mathematical with detailed analyses of many classical cryptosystems meyer and matyas concentrate on modern cryptographic methods especially pertaining to key management and the integration of security facilities into computer systems and networks the books of rueppel rue and koblitz kob concentrate on the application of number theory and algebra to cryptography how does one go about cryptanalysis classical cryptanalysis involves an interesting combination of analytical reasoning application of mathematical tools pattern finding patience determination and luck the best available textbooks on the subject are the military cryptanalytics series frie it is clear that proficiency in cryptanalysis is for the most part gained through the attempted solution of given systems such experience is considered so valuable that some of the cryptanalyses performed during wwii by the allies are still classified modern public key cryptanalysis may consist of factoring an integer or taking a discrete logarithm these are not the traditional fare of the cryptanalyst computational number theorists are some of the most successful cryptanalysts against public key systems what is a brute force search and what is its cryptographic relevance in a nutshell if f x y and you know y and can compute f you can find x by trying every possible x that s brute force search example say a cryptanalyst has found a plaintext and a corresponding ciphertext but doesn t know the key he can simply try encrypting the plaintext using each possible key until the ciphertext matches or decrypting the ciphertext to match the plaintext whichever is faster every well designed cryptosystem has such a large key space that this brute force search is impractical advances in technology sometimes change what is considered practical for example des which has been in use for over years now has or about possible keys a computation with this many operations was certainly unlikely for most users in the mid s the situation is very different today given the dramatic decrease in cost per processor operation massively parallel machines threaten the security of des against brute force search some scenarios are described by garron and outerbridge gar one phase of a more sophisticated cryptanalysis may involve a brute force search of some manageably small space of possibilities what are some properties satisfied by every strong cryptosystem the security of a strong system resides with the secrecy of the key rather than with an attempt to keep the algorithm itself secret a strong cryptosystem has a large keyspace as mentioned above the unicity distance is a measure which gives the minimum amount of ciphertext that must be intercepted to uniquely identify the key and if for some key the unicity distance is much longer than the amount of ciphertext you intend to encrypt under that key the system is probably strong a strong cryptosystem will certainly produce ciphertext which appears random to all standard statistical tests see for example cae a strong cryptosystem will resist all known previous attacks a system which has never been subjected to scrutiny is suspect if a system passes all the tests mentioned above is it necessarily strong certainly not many weak cryptosystems looked good at first however sometimes it is possible to show that a cryptosystem is strong by mathematical proof if joe can break this system then he can also solve the well known difficult problem of factoring integers see part failing that it s a crap shoot if a cryptosystem is theoretically unbreakable then is it guaranteed analysis proof in practice cryptanalytic methods include what is known as practical cryptanalysis the enemy doesn t have to just stare at your ciphertext until he figures out the plaintext for instance he might assume cribs stretches of probable plaintext if the crib is correct then he might be able to deduce the key and then decipher the rest of the message or he might exploit isologs the same plaintext enciphered in several cryptosystems or several keys thus he might obtain solutions even when cryptanalytic theory says he doesn t have a chance sometimes cryptosystems malfunction or are misused the one time pad for example loses all security if it is used more than once even chosen plaintext attacks where the enemy somehow feeds plaintext into the encryptor until he can deduce the key have been employed see kah why are many people still using cryptosystems that are relatively easy to break some don t know any better often amateurs think they can design secure systems and are not aware of what an expert cryptanalyst could do and sometimes there is insufficient motivation for anybody to invest the work needed to crack a system

differential cryptanalysis how was nsa involved in the design of des is des available in software is des available in hardware can des be used to protect classified information what are ecb cbc cfb and ofb encryption what is a product cipher a product cipher is a block cipher that iterates several weak operations such as substitution transposition modular addition multiplication and linear transformation a block cipher just means a cipher that encrypts a block of data bytes say all at once then goes on to the next block the notion of product ciphers is due to shannon sha examples of modern product ciphers include lucifer sor des nbs sp networks kam loki bro feal shi pes lai khufu and khafre me a the so called feistel ciphers are a class of product ciphers which operate on one half of the ciphertext at each round and then swap the ciphertext halves after each round lucifer des loki and feal are examples of feistel ciphers the following table compares the main parameters of several product ciphers cipher block length key bits number of rounds lucifer des loki feal x x pes what makes a product cipher secure nobody knows how to prove mathematically that a product cipher is completely secure so in practice one begins by demonstrating that the cipher looks highly random for example the cipher must be nonlinear and it must produce ciphertext which functionally depends on every bit of the plaintext and the key meyer mey has shown that at least rounds of des are required to guarantee such a dependence in this sense a product cipher should act as a mixing function which combines the plaintext key and ciphertext in a complex nonlinear fashion the fixed per round substitutions of the product cipher are referred to as s boxes for example lucifer has s boxes and des has s boxes the nonlinearity of a product cipher reduces to a careful design of these s boxes a list of partial design criteria for the s boxes of des which apply to s boxes in general may be found in brown bro and brickell et al bri what are some group theoretic properties of product ciphers let e be a product cipher that maps n bit blocks to n bit blocks let e k x be the encryption of x under key k then for any fixed k the map sending x to e k x is a permutation of the set of n bit blocks denote this permutation by p k the set of all n bit permutations is called the symmetric group and is written s n the collection of all these permutations p k where k ranges over all possible keys is denoted e s n if e were a random mapping from plaintexts to ciphertexts then we would expect e s n to generate a large subset of s n coppersmith and grossman cop have shown that a very simple product cipher can generate the alternating group a n given a sufficient number of rounds the alternating group is half of the symmetric group it consists of all even permutations i e all permutations which can be written as an even number of swaps even and goldreich eve were able to extend these results to show that feistel ciphers can generate a n given a sufficient number of rounds the security of multiple encipherment also depends on the group theoretic properties of a cipher multiple encipherment is an extension over single encipherment if for keys k k there does not exist a third key k such that e k e k x e k x which indicates that encrypting twice with two independent keys k k is equal to a single encryption under the third key k if for every k k there exists a k such that eq is true then we say that e is a group this question of whether des is a group under this definition was extensively studied by sherman kaliski and rivest she in their paper they give strong evidence for the hypothesis that des is not a group in fact des is not a group cam what can be proven about the security of a product cipher recall from above that p k is a permutation produced by e under some key k the goal of the designer of e is to ensure that p k appears to be a random element of s n the symmetric group let r be an element of s n selected randomly we will say that p k and r are indistinguishable if an observer given p k and r in some order cannot distinguish between these two permutations in polynomial time that is with time bounded resources the observer cannot determine which of the permutations is produced by e the optimal decision is no better than simply guessing luby and rackoff lub have shown that a class of feistel ciphers are secure in this sense when the round mapping is replaced by random boolean functions how are block ciphers used to encrypt data longer than the block size there are four standard modes of operation and numerous non standard ones as well the standard modes of operation are defined in the u s department of commerce federal information processing standard fips published in see the question about ecb below for more details although they are defined for the des block cipher the modes of operation can be used with any block cipher can symmetric block ciphers be used for message authentication one may use a symmetric cryptosystem block cipher to prove to himself that he did or did not generate a message and to prove to himself whether his message was altered or unaltered since generation but one cannot prove these things to another without revealing the key and thereafter that key cannot be used to prove anything about any messages that were authenticated using that key see ansi x and fips for a standard method of message authentication using des what exactly is des des is the u s government s data encryption standard a product cipher that operates on bit blocks of data using a bit key it is defined in fips which supersedes fips fips are federal information processing standards published by ntis des is identical to the ansi standard data encryption algorithm dea defined in ansi x what is triple des triple des is a product cipher which like des operates on bit data blocks there are several forms each of which uses the des cipher times some forms use two bit keys some use three the des modes of operation may also be used with triple des some people refer to e k d k e k x as triple des this method is defined in chapter of the ansi standard x financial institution key management and is intended for use in encrypting des keys and ivs for automated key distribution its formal name is encryption and decryption of a single key by a key pair but it is referenced in other standards documents as ede that standard says section key encrypting keys may be a single dea key or a dea key pair key pairs shoud be used where additional security is needed e g the data protected by the key s has a long security life a key pair shall not be encrypted or decrypted using a single key others use the term triple des for e k d k e k x or e k e k e k x one of us carl ellison keeps advocating des triple use in the form e k tran e k tran e k compress x where each des instance has its own key and iv for cbc mode and tran has been posted on sci crypt it is a large block transposition program taking its key from the data stream itself so that it is not an encryption program on its own part what is differential cryptanalysis differential cryptanalysis is a statistical attack that can be applied to any iterated mapping ie any mapping which is based on a repeated round function the method was recently popularized by biham and shamir bih but coppersmith has remarked that the s boxes of des were optimized against this attack some years ago this method has proved effective against several product ciphers notably feal bi a differential cryptanalysis is based on observing a large number of ciphertexts y y whose corresponding plaintexts x x satisfy a known difference d x x where is componentwise xor in the basic biham shamir attack such plaintext pairs are required to determine the key for des substantially fewer pairs are required if des is truncated to or rounds in these cases the actual key can be recovered in a matter of minutes using a few thousand pairs for full des this attack is impractical because it requires so many known plaintexts the work of biham and shamir on des revealed several startling observations on the algorithm most importantly if the key schedule was removed from des and a bit key was used the key could be recovered in less than steps thus independent subkeys do not add substantial security to des further the s boxes of des are extremely sensitive in that changing even single entries in these tables yields significant improvement in the differential attack adi shamir is quoted to say nytimes oct i would say that contrary to what some people believe there is no evidence of tampering with the des so that the basic design was weakened how was nsa involved in the design of des according to kinnucan kin tuchman a member of the group that developed des at ibm is quoted as saying we developed the des algorithm entirely within ibm using ibmers the nsa did not dictate a single wire tuchman and meyer another developer of des spent a year breaking ciphers and finding weaknesses in lucifer they then spent two years strengthening lucifer their basic approach was to look for strong substitution permutation and key scheduling functions ibm has classified the notes containing the selection criteria at the request of the nsa the nsa told us we had inadvertently reinvented some of the deep secrets it uses to make its own algorithms explains tuchman on the other hand a document called involvement of the nsa in the development of des unclassified summary of the united states select committee on intelligence printed in the ieee communications magazine p states in the development of des nsa convinced ibm that a reduced keysize was sufficient indirectly assisted in the development of the s box structures and certified that the final des algorithm was to the best of their knowledge free from any statistical or mathematical weakness clearly the key size was reduced at the insistence of the nsa the article further states that the nsa did not tamper with the algorithm itself just the parameters which in some sense resolves the apparent conflict in the remarks of meyer and tuchman presented above is des available in software several people have made des code available via ftp see part for pathnames stig ostholm ftpso bsd

and news answers every days contents what is the national security agency nsa what are the us export regulations what is tempest what are the beale ciphers and are they a hoax what is the american cryptogram association and how do i get in touch is rsa patented what about the voynich manuscript what is the national security agency nsa the nsa is the official security body of the u s government it was given its charter by president truman in the late s and has continued research in cryptology till the present the nsa is known to be the largest employer of mathematicians in the world and is also the largest purchaser of computer hardware in the world governments in general have always been prime employers of cryptologists the nsa probably possesses cryptographic expertise many years ahead of the public state of the art and can undoubtedly break many of the systems used in practice but for reasons of national security almost all information about the nsa is classified bamford s book bamfd gives a history of the people and operations of the nsa the following quote from massey mas highlights the difference between public and private research in cryptography if one regards cryptology as the prerogative of government one accepts that most cryptologic research will be conducted behind closed doors without doubt the number of workers engaged today in such secret research in cryptology far exceeds that of those engaged in open research in cryptology for only about years has there in fact been widespread open research in cryptology there have been and will continue to be conflicts between these two research communities open research is common quest for knowledge that depends for its vitality on the open exchange of ideas via conference presentations and publications in scholarly journals but can a government agency charged with responsibilities of breaking the ciphers of other nations countenance the publication of a cipher that it cannot break can a researcher in good conscience publish such a cipher that might undermine the effectiveness of his own government s code breakers one might argue that publication of a provably secure cipher would force all governments to behave like stimson s gentlemen but one must be aware that open research in cryptography is fraught with political and ethical considerations of a severity than in most scientific fields the wonder is not that some conflicts have occurred between government agencies and open researchers in cryptology but rather that these conflicts at least those of which we are aware have been so few and so mild what are the us export regulations in a nutshell there are two government agencies which control export of encryption software one is the bureau of export administration bxa in the department of commerce authorized by the export administration regulations ear another is the office of defense trade controls dtc in the state department authorized by the international traffic in arms regulations itar as a rule of thumb bxa which works with cocom has less stringent requirements but dtc which takes orders from nsa wants to see everything first and can refuse to transfer jurisdiction to bxa the newsgroup misc legal computing carries many interesting discussions on the laws surrounding cryptographic export what people think about those laws and many other complex issues which go beyond the scope of technical groups like sci crypt make sure to consult your lawyer before doing anything which will get you thrown in jail if you are lucky your lawyer might know a lawyer who has at least heard of the itar what is tempest tempest is a standard for electromagnetic shielding for computer equipment it was created in response to the discovery that information can be read from computer radiation e g from a crt at quite a distance and with little effort needless to say encryption doesn t do much good if the cleartext is available this way what are the beale ciphers and are they a hoax thanks to jim gillogly for this information and john king for corrections the story in a pamphlet by j b ward goes thomas jefferson beale and a party of adventurers accumulated a huge mass of treasure and buried it in bedford county virginia leaving three ciphers with an innkeeper the ciphers describe the location contents and intended beneficiaries of the treasure ward gives a decryption of the second cipher contents called b it was encrypted as a book cipher using the initial letters of the declaration of independence doi as key b and b are unsolved many documents have been tried as the key to b aficionados can join a group that attempts to solve b by various means with an eye toward splitting the treasure the beale cypher association p o box beaver falls pa you can get the ciphers from the rec puzzles faql by including the line send index in a message to netlib peregrine com and following the directions there are apparently several different versions of the cipher floating around the correct version is based on the pamphlet says john king kingj hpcc corp hp com some believe the story is a hoax kruh kru gives a long list of problems with the story gillogly gil decrypted b with the doi and found some unexpected strings including abfdefghiijklmmnohpp hammer president of the beale cypher association agrees that this string couldn t appear by chance but feels there must be an explanation gwyn sci crypt expert is unimpressed with this string what is the american cryptogram association and how do i get in touch the aca is

sci.crypt	clipper some new thoughts i d desparately prefer it if we didn t rehash the same arguments that went on ad infinitum last time that s especially true for sci crypt for that matter i ve created alt privacy clipper since the traffic is appearing in many different groups right now i m going to focus here on some technical aspects of the plan hence my followup to sci crypt frankly if you re not an absolutist your feelings may turn on some of these issues for example with an bit key simply splitting it into two bit pieces is much less acceptable than other schemes because it means that if just one repository is shall we say overly pliable a would be eavesdropper would need to recover just more bits of key i need not point out in this newsgroup that that s pretty easy to do by exhaustive search a slightly more complex scheme xor ing the key with a random number and then with its complement would produce two bit subkeys neither of which is useful alone that variant is much more resistant to attack clearly one can get even more sophisticated to protect the subkeys even more other thoughts some people have noted the size and complexity of the databases necessary but the id strings the phones emit could be their back door key double encrypted with the escrow repositories public keys for that matter they could do that only with session keys and have no back door at all in that case the fbi would have to bring every intercept to the repositories to be decrypted this would answer many of the objections along the lines of how do you make sure they stop we can even combine that with a variant of the digital telephony back door have the switch do the tap but with a digitally signed record of the time phone number etc of the call that provides proof to the escrow agents that the tap was done in compliance with the terms of the warrant i can suggest other variations too suppose each clipper chip had public key pairs each would be used times after which you d need more keying material not a bad idea in any event this could be used to enforce time limits or rather usage limits on each warrant the keys the repository agents would deliver wouldn t last for very long i suspect that the cryptographic algorithm itself is secure apart from the obvious why push a weak algorithm when you ve already got the back door i think that the government is still genuinely concerned about foreign espionage especially aimed at commercial targets this scheme lets the spooks have their cake and eat it too i ve heard rumors over the years that some factions within nsa were unhappy with des because it was too good not that they couldn t crack it but it was much too expensive to do so as easily as they d want they re keeping the details secret so that others don t build their own implementations without the back door the cryptographic protocol though is another matter i see no valid reasons for keeping it secret and as i hope i ve shown above there are a lot of ways to do things that aren t quite as bad

accuracy of this article but if accurate i find it extremely disturbing especially in light of various abuses of the ssn number regarding privacy i understand it is now to be required in ca to renew a drivers license or to register a car and other proposals regarding smart national identity cards wiretap proposals and such one simply wonders what other gems are in the wings ready to be sprung on the people by our government perhaps suggestions and ideas for preventing this and other such proposals from acquiring the force of law would be useful the cost simply outweighs any possible benefits imo btw reading this makes me think of some ideas a prof denning has been promoting in an even more disturbing form that said with no further comment the article follows begin included article note this file will also be available via anonymous file transfer from csrc ncsl nist gov in directory pub nistnews and via the nist computer security bbs at the white house office of the press secretary for immediate release april statement by the press secretary the president today announced a new initiative that will bring the federal government together with industry in a voluntary program to improve the security and privacy of telephone communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement the initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links for too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting americans rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth privacy and law enforcement previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer it is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files while encryption technology can help americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information it also can be used by terrorists drug dealers and other criminals a state of the art microcircuit called the clipper chip has been developed by government engineers the chip represents a new approach to encryption technology it can be used in new relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary telephone it scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today this new technology will help companies protect proprietary information protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically at the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals a key escrow system will be established to ensure that the clipper chip is used to protect the privacy of law abiding americans each device containing the chip will have two unique keys numbers that will be needed by authorized government agencies to decode messages encoded by the device when the device is manufactured the two keys will be deposited separately in two key escrow data bases that will be established by the attorney general access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap the clipper chip technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of americans to demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology the attorney general will soon purchase several thousand of the new devices in addition respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings the chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption s dual edge sword encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry but it also can shield criminals and terrorists we need the clipper chip and other approaches that can both provide law abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities in order to assess technology trends and explore new approaches like the key escrow system the president has directed government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates the privacy of our citizens including the need to employ voice or data encryption for business purposes the ability of authorized officials to access telephone calls and data under proper court or other legal order when necessary to protect our citizens the effective and timely use of the most modern technology to build the national information infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and the competitiveness of american industry in the global marketplace and the need of u s companies to manufacture and export high technology products the president has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries the congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed the administration is committed to working with the private sector to spur the development of a national information infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies to give americans unprecedented access to information this infrastructure of high speed networks information superhighways will transmit video images hdtv programming and huge data files as easily as today s telephone system transmits voice since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure the federal government must act quickly to develop consistent comprehensive policies regarding its use the administration is committed to policies that protect all americans right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet the provisions of the president s directive to acquire the new encryption technology are also available for additional details call mat heyman national institute of standards and technology questions and answers about the clinton administration s telecommunications initiative q does this approach expand the authority of government agencies to listen in on phone conversations a no clipper chip technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of americans q suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation encrypted using the device what would they have to do to decipher the message a they would have to obtain legal authorization normally a court order to do the wiretap in the first place they would then present documentation of this authorization to the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug smugglers the key is split into two parts which are stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key escrow system q who will run the key escrow data banks a the two key escrow data banks will be run by two independent entities at this point the department of justice and the administration have yet to determine which agencies will oversee the key escrow data banks q how strong is the security in the device how can i be sure how strong the security is a this system is more secure than many other voice encryption systems readily available today while the algorithm will remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow system we are willing to invite an independent panel of cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all potential users that there are no unrecognized vulnerabilities q whose decision was it to propose this product a the national security council the justice department the commerce department and other key agencies were involved in this decision this approach has been endorsed by the president the vice president and appropriate cabinet officials q who was consulted the congress industry a we have on going discussions with congress and industry on encryption issues and expect those discussions to intensify as we carry out our review of encryption policy we have briefed members of congress and industry leaders on the decisions related to this initiative q will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers a the government designed and developed the key access encryption microcircuits but it is not providing the microcircuits to product manufacturers product manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip manufacturer that produces them q who provides the clipper chip a mykotronx programs it at their facility in torrance california and will sell the chip to encryption device manufacturers the programming function could be licensed to other vendors in the future q how do i buy one of these encryption devices a we expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating the clipper chip into their devices q if the administration were unable to find a technological solution like the one proposed would the administration be willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more powerful encryption devices a this is a fundamental policy question which will be considered during the broad policy review the key escrow mechanism will provide americans with an encryption product that is more secure more convenient and less expensive than others readily available today but it is just one piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to encryption technology which the administration is developing the administration is not saying since encryption threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement we will prohibit it outright as some countries have effectively done nor is the u s saying that every american as a matter of right is entitled to an unbreakable commercial encryption product there is a false tension created in the assessment that this issue is an either or proposition rather both concerns can be and in fact are harmoniously balanced through a reasoned balanced approach such as is proposed with the clipper chip and similar encryption techniques q what does this decision indicate about how the clinton administration s policy toward encryption will differ from that of the bush administration a it indicates that we understand the importance of encryption technology in telecommunications and computing and are committed to working with industry and public interest groups to find innovative ways to protect americans privacy help businesses to compete and ensure that law enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime and terrorism q will the devices be exportable will other devices that use the government hardware a voice encryption devices are subject to export control requirements case by case review for each export is required to ensure appropriate use of these devices the same is true for other encryption devices one of the attractions of this technology is the protection it can give to u s companies operating at home and abroad with this in mind we expect export licenses will be granted on a case by case basis for u s companies seeking to use these devices to secure their own communications abroad we plan to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability of these

writes but is it any worse than the current unsecure system it becomes much worse of course if the government then uses this clinton clipper to argue for restrictions on unapproved encryption this is the main concern of most of us i think the camel s nose in the tent etc not to pick on mr may in particular of course but isn t this kind of the domino theory when one little country falls its neighbor will surely follow and before you know it we re all mining salt in siberia for not turning in our captain crunch secret decoder rings i wish i could agree with you ask yourself this why would any private sector entity wish to buy a crypto system that was known to be at least partially compromised key escrows in this instance why would any private sector entity wish to buy a crypto system that had not been properly evaluated i e algorythm not publically released the answer seems obvious to me they wouldn t there is other hardware out there not compromised des as an example triple des as a better one my suspicion is that the prices will drop dramatically on these non clipper systems if not we re in trouble given that the clinton administration is not entirely stupid although we d like to think so i cannot believe that they have failed to realize this they know their initiative will fail much as crippled des was never taken seriously the only way their moves can work is by coercion you know little about politics if you don t realize that this is just a first step in the next move it makes no sense otherwise the next move banning or severly crippling crypto not using the clipper system is easily justified why would anyone want other encryption unless they were trying to subvert the government we ve provided you with a very secure alternative so use it or go to jail be fined whatever how can you reconcile the administrations self proclaimed purpose of providing law enforcement with access to encrypted data without making the clipper system the only crypto available in the u s you simply can t and the administration knows it anyone who wanted to keep the govt out of their hair be it for drug dealing or whatever would just buy still available non clipper systems don t sell our crafty clinton types short they can t be that stupid either banning non clipper crypto is the next answer or the administrations collective i q is about that of a potato why do you think at t jumped on so fast they know it s going to be big and not because it s better right on the face of it noone will buy the stuff that doesn t have to at t must know this too think man why the hell would they jump the gun my interpretation andrew tim may whose sig block may get him busted in the new regime isn t this just a little melodramatic i really wonder to wit the letter i just sent to clinton the white house office of the press secretary c o presidential comment line fax april sir and or madam i must object most strongly to the administrations evolving position on encryption and cryptography i am shocked at the clinton regimes increasing lean towards a authoritarian approach with regard to privacy and freedom from government oversight in day to day life it is apparent to me that those who drafted the clipper chip proposal which is incidentally gaining notoriety as the big brother proposal are either incredibly ignorant or very sly indeed anyone knowledgeable in the nuances of cryptographic development and research must understand that a key step in the development of a new algorithm especially one destined for standardization is the full disclosure of the algorithm to the private and academic sectors the proper evaluation of an algorithm dep ends on careful scrutiny by these sectors and only such scrutiny can provide true public confidence in the security of the algorithm the assumption that a new algorithm will be accepted based on assurances from experts without full disclosure is plain ignorance in addition the assumption that an algorithm will be marketable over other technology such as des when it is characterized by key escrow is lunacy it seems an easy step in the logic chain that probable consumers will prefer to purchase equipment not crippled by government key escrow no matter how tamper proof the key escrows might be i cannot believe that even the least educated policy maker would have failed to realize these flaws i can only assume then that the drafters of the clipper chip proposal knew very well the difficulties of selling a crippled system to the private sector the only way this proposal makes any sense or has any chance of succeeding is in coercion even the language of the proposal makes it painfully clear that the next logical step is the outlawing of other encryption devices and hardware that do not uti lize the big brother chip unfortunately the public at large is not educated enough on the issue to realize what they are losing i expect the big brother proposal to encounter little resistance from the american people who you will have so efficiently duped once again with pretty words like harmony right to encryption and voluntary it mortifies me that the phrase that seems to be used more and more

sci.crypt	re once tapped your code is no good any more in article apr clarinet com brad clarinet com brad templeton writes in article tcmayc m xv jex netcom com tcmay netcom com timothy c may writes getting the court order to reveal the key also makes decipherable all past conversations which may be on tape or disk or whatver as i understand the proposal i could be wrong but i ve seen no mention of session keys being the escrowed entities true in theory in practice the technology of cellular phones will probably be spread spectrum and quite difficult to record the crypttext without the key if the frequency path depends on they key as i understand it to it could be made effectively impossible to record i am not an expert in the cryptography science but some basic things seem evident to me things which this clinton clipper do not address the all pertain to opportunites for abuse and conclusions based on what i have seen the membership of this group except for two notable persons agree to if anything bad is possible by the government in theory it almost always ends up happening in fact so the key is to make abuse impossible question authority and remember power does corrupt i think one has to regard this whole idea in the sense that it will be expanded to include other data forms such as data transfer and stored data and as such should be treated as if it were expanded or such expansion will be almost impossible to stop using clipper as a precident there was a hint of that in the proposal remember that said please bear with me i am not very articulate so i take more words to say what others could say much more briefly thank you once it hits land you can record it if you have telco access the telco isn t supposed to give that without a warrant that s the rule today as i suggested this is now the hint is in the proposal that this or similar proposals are being considered for other forms of encryptions such as data transfer data files and such largely dependent on how this thing is accepted or flies i think one would be wise to treat this in the manner one would when not if it gets expanded to other areas than cellular phones i think this is guaranteed to happen if this proposal gets by salami politics it has been and is used in several other areas it is certain to be used here government is not going to easily give up on the idea that they should be able to eavesedrop whenever they want to court order required has proven to be a rather flimsy guarantee if the case warrants they can always sieze the material and force one to give the key or sit in jail forever on periodically renewed contempt charges so it is not denying the justice system the information nor the ability to lock someone up if guilty or refuses to divulge the means to access the info this is not protected under the fifth one can be forced to perform acts that would result in divulging incriminating evidence so blocking restrictions on private encryption is not preventing legitimate law enforcement it does make illegitimate law enforcement a bunch more difficult especially fishing expeditions without the target s knowlege don t give up the right to be safe from that that should be non negotiable and clinton and co know it which is probably why they quietly developed this thing figuring if they get it this far they can ram it on through how come those consulted could be roughly described as us insiders they cannot quietely impliment it though when they ban other schemes to ensure its exclusive use hence the nice pr document to try and reassure everyone don t buy into it has government really earned that kind of trust past or future to be secure and free one must keep government honest and the only way to do that is to make abuse impossible not unlikely or difficult but even so the evidence would not be admissible i think unless the judge so ordered i think that even interception of the crypttext without a warrant would be illegal cops can t record today s plain cellular calls and then ask a judge hey can we have permission to listen to those tapes can they so what one could use information gained by re use of the keys saved after the last case was finished or other means master key backdoor easily broken algorithm to find other evidence which given to a judge would authorize a tap which wouldn t have been possible otherwise this has been the more common manner of abuse of wiretaps in the past for local cops this might be workable to keep them honest but the feds have a workaround somehow bet on it does anyone really believe for example that the government will use a scheme nsa cannot listen in on scanning for keywords either easily defeated in realtime or via a master key i sure don t this whole thing sounds like something to eliminate the need to use old fashioned police work to build a case in the past eavesdropping was rather easy with or without a court order i think the law enforcement community has become a bit spoiled and will resist changes that require them to revert to using old fashioned detective work i just find it somewhat surprising coming from a bunch that cares so much about civil and individual rights that puts people first the question is put people first to where with the innards not being revealed how is one to be sure there doesn t exist a master key for use by nsa etc so they can do their keyword scan etc on conversations they routinely monitor without a specific court order remember the cellular phone limitiation is only temporary bet on it and so far i have not heard about police telling people that they have been tapped and nothing incriminating was found what is to keep them from simply keeping the keys on file for next time after awhile they would have quite a collection kept especially for folks they deem disruptive and if they get only one key that would reduce the search space a lot unless it is an rsa scheme remember nixon years need for court orders really slowed them down didn t it and unless the escrow accounts are not government controlled fat chance i see one ending up being under say treasury the other under justice it could be worth some serious bucks to some folks to get keys to a competitor s clinton clipper or descendent when this idea is expanded to be used for all non government encryption enough bucks would get one the keys or the innards for this algorithm perhaps not an important concern but given past government behavior and the other problems worse of course if the government then uses this clinton clipper to argue for restrictions on unapproved encryption this is the main concern of most of us i think the camel s nose in the tent etc yes that is a major concern but i think that they think they can win just by having of the usa use this system they don t even have to care about the cautious that s left they don t catch the really smart crooks anyway john gotti who would have to be retarded not to realize he was likely to be wiretapped glibly chatted away on his tapped phone about murder plans that s why he s in jail now hard to believe but true what will one do when it is expanded to data storage encryption you can bet that if clipper is accepted that will be next on the agenda it is even hinted at in the proposal read it carefully expect the argumet well if you got nothing to hide fine then using that argument one should not object to video cameras being installed in every room of one s home granted an exteme expansion of the idea but the principle holds private stuff should remain private even from a govt fishing expedition and laws rules may change in the future as to safeguards when it comes to the fed government safeguards are pretty meaningless if they want to do get something don t work so hard to give up some rather treasured rights or establish bad precidents please the price could be hell to pay later this scheme can succeed without laws forbidding more which people would fight a lot harder they like this enough that they are dropping the so called digital telephony proposal according to rumours however the meaning of that is complex since they still want to get at the crypttext on telco systems and that requires a bit of work people would fight laws forbidding more now but in say two years because we have this crisis situation which must be addressed by some drastic action just this added reasonable restriction will only bother those who have someting to hide etc please don t buy into it if the clinton clipper is so very good why not make its algrithm public so many people can exchange ideas and examine it rather than a few isolated respected experts respected by whom for what perhaps a certain professor who likes key banks would be one of the selected experts this does seem to expand on some ideas the person was advocating if i recall how would anybody know that what the experts examine is the same as what will end up being used in the clipper chip if it is kept secret perhaps the clipper will use a crippled version with a master key provision or features not present in the version subjected for study and evaluation by the experts and who chooses the expertes the government no conflict of interest there and isn t it a requirement for any decent encryption scheme that it not have its effectiveness reduced by having the algrorithm widely known i was lead to believe that one should assume the other side has everything you have except for the key s i recall ideas presented to this group are rejected if a requirement exists the algorithm be secret another question since it is a safe bet this clipper thing would not be used for government security they are regarding it as not real secure but good enough for common folk i think i would like to see a full description not a pr non statement of just what good enough means i think when saying how strong it is good enough really means not very the excuse that other countries have these restrictions is not acceptable other countries do not have our bill of rights and constitution which the people not the governments of those other countries often regard with envy what we have as rights they have as revokable privileges and if we expect to retain those rights and protections we must not allow them to be gutted because we just gotta have this thing to fight crime we have allready have our bill of rights pretty much torn to shreds we should not permit more weakining for yet another noble cause instead we should be trying to repair the damage our crime problem may have a number of causes but too many rights and safeguards is not a signifigant one a broken court system and poor police work are a much more signifigant cause as having too many rights disregarding addressing the root causes for crime etc btw those who suggest that this is just an attack on clinton believe this i would be going ballistic reagardless who seriously proposed this thing it is just another step in a gradual erosion of our rights under the constitution or bill of rights the last couple of decades have been a non stop series of end runs around the protections of the

details are fascinating date sat apr pdt from martin hellman hellman isl stanford edu to a long list of recipients subject clipper chip most of you have seen the announcement in friday s ny times etc about nist national institute of standards technology announcing the clipper chip crypto device several messges on the net have asked for more technical details and some have been laboring under understandable misunderstandings given the lack of details in the news articles so here to help out is your friendly nsa link me i was somewhat surprised friday to get a call from the agency which supplied many of the missing details i was told the info was public so here it is the cc of this to dennis branstad at nist is mostly as a double check on my facts since i assume he is aware of all this please let me know if i have anything wrong the clipper chip will have a secret crypto algorithm embedded in silicon each chip will have two secret bit keys one will be the same for all chips ie a system wide key and the other will be unit specific i don t know what nist and nsa will call them but i will call them the system key sk and unit key uk in this message the ic will be designed to be extremely difficult to reverse so that the system key can be kept secret aside it is clear that they also want to keep the algorithm secret and in my opinion it may be as much for that as this stated purpose the unit key will be generated as the xor of two bit random numbers k and k uk k k which will be kept by the two escrow authorities who these escrow authorities will be is still to be decided by the attorney general but it was stressed to me that they will not be nsa or law enforcement agencies that they must be parties acceptable to the users of the system as unbiased when a law enforcement agency gets a court order they will present it to these two escrow authorities and receive k and k thereby allowing access to the unit key uk in addition to the system key each user will get to choose his or her own key and change it as often as desired call this key plain old k when a message is to be sent it will first be encrypted under k then k will be encrypted under the unit key uk and the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part message which will then be encrypted under the system key sk producing e e m k e k uk serial number sk when a court order obtains k and k and thence k the law enforcement agency will use sk to decrypt all information flowing on the suspected link aside it is my guess that they may do this constantly on all links with or without a court order since it is almost impossible to tell which links over which a message will flow this gives the agency access to e m k e k uk serial number in the above message they then check the serial number of the unit and see if it is on the watch list for which they have a court order if so they will decrypt e k uk to obtain k and then decrypt e m k to obtain m i am still in the process of assessing this scheme so please do not take the above as any kind of endorsement of the proposed scheme all i am trying to do is help all of us assess the scheme more knowledgably but i will say that the need for just one court order worries me i would feel more comfortable though not necessarily comfortable if two separate court orders were needed one per escrow authority while no explanation is needed the following story adds some color in researching some ideas that silvio micali and i have been kicking around i spoke with gerald gunther the constitutional law expert here at stanford and he related the following story when edward levi became pres ford s attorney general right after watergate he was visited by an fbi agent asking for the wiretap authorizations when levy asked for the details so he could review the cases as required by law the agent told him that his predecessors just turned over blank signed forms every time levi did not comply and changed the system but the lesson is clear no single person or authority should have the power to authorize wiretaps or worse yet divulging of personal keys sometimes he or she will be an edward levi and sometimes a john

sci.crypt	big brother clipper chip there are some issues which come to mind when one considers the law enforcement aspects of the use of the big brother clipper chip the drug dealers and terrorists aren t going to let themselves be caught by using this type of encryption in the new york times reported that government investigators broke up a narcotics ring that was operating highly sophisticated equipment capable of allowing the leaders of the ring to eavesdrop on the law enforcement agents who were trying to arrest them a mr deely an nsa official said there are a lot of medium sized countries that would have been proud to have the signals intelligence operation of this group for every john gotti there are probably many more people who have the sophistication to know what the risks of unsecure communications are the press given to the big brother chip will only increase their numbers even if there is some benefit to law enforcement through the use of big brother it must be weighed against the constitutional and civil liberties questions involved for example in some areas of the world torture is used as an investigative tool by the local law enforcement people i suspect it is an effective means of obtaining information and shortening many investigations it probably also helps keep the conviction rate high the fact that the torture tool is not used in this country even with a court order obtained by showing probable cause is because we have rightly balanced the questions of expediency and what is ethically and morally right i think that the same question of expediency versus morality should come into play when considering the use of big brother i vote for morality i am quite disturbed by what i interpret as a veiled threat to prohibit the use of all encryption if this big brother chip is not put into wide spread use after a quick reading of the white house press release i came away with that impression to most of the american public the word hacker has rightly or wrongly come to mean high tech adolescent vandal it has struck me that most of the people posting to sci crypt regarding this issue are intelligent thoughtful individuals who have genuine concerns about the privacy and constitutional issues surrounding big brother i hope that the use of big brother does not become mandatory and other encryption become illegal i would hate to see this become some kind of high tech volstead act the high speed digital communications revolution is coming at us with the speed of an sst the times they are a changing and just as ibm is learning that they can t do business the same way they have done it for the past years maybe nsa should evaluate another approach eff who have correctly questioned the cryptographic strength of big brother may need to send a stronger message out regarding the constitutional issues involved al gore may want to think this one through a little more and as for dorothy elizabeth robling denning en quoi cela vous concerne cheri

proposal clearly states the initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links it speaks about telecommunications in general read it again david maybe you ll understand it the next time nah probably not encryption then it is an improvement over the current mass produced standard civilian technology which with a few exceptions is limited to easy to break inverters that s exactly what the government wants all sheep minded people to think let s look at the current situation it allows to almost anybody to eavesdrop almost everybody unless secure and i mean secure encryption is used what will happen when if ha optimists the new proposal gets accepted almost nobody except some will be able to eavesdrop everybody else but the ability of these some to eavesdrop will be guaranteed the proposal emphasizes on the former almost nobody which is clearly an improvement and forgets to mention the drawbacks of the latter guaranteed yes my statement assumes that the next step will be to make the strong crypto unlawful you think that it will not happen good luck note that the big issue for the feds is the continued ability to wiretap it s not just continued ability it s guaranteed ability before we go off the deep end with long discusions about secure crypto for e mail and files let s focus on this yeah that s exactly what your government wants you to think let s take small steps one at a time concentrate on the current one don t think about the future trust us one question that was not asked in the release is whether this proposal is limited to telephony or if the government intends to expand it it s not asked because the proposal clearly says that this is the intention they unlike you read what they write though i share many of the concerns expressed by some i find the proposal less threatening than many others since right now most americans have no secure telephony and any jerk with a pair of clip leads and a goat can eavesdrop this would also plug up the security hole in cellular and cordless phones yes it will it will stop the jerk who is eavesdropping now it will allow only to the government to eavesdrop if the scheme is secure of course which is yet to be proven but how do you know that the jerk you are fearing now will not get a government job tomorrow the new proposal guarantees him the ability to eavesdrop then hell that will even motivate him to get that job if he indeed is that mentally pervert reading between the lines i infer that the system is highly secure without access to the keys great the greatest cryptographer of all times david sternlight tm has succeeded to evaluate the new system in the absense of any details whatsoever and has concluded that it is highly secure i guess that comes from the background of working some years for the two major crypto evaluating companies right gee now the government can save all that money and trouble to ask a secret council of crypto experts to secretly analyse the new secret method for david sternlight has already done all the job for them this would meet the needs of u s businesses confronted by rich and powerful adversaries including french and japanese security services and rich japanese companies it allows the nsa to make available some

future safety do not deserve either this or something like that i don t have the exact quote but the meaning is the same has been said by one of your great men maybe you should study their works more carefully if you have the brains to understand them of course from my point of view this is a fair starting point there are concerns that need to be addressed including the reliability of the escrows but in the main question is to guarantee to availability of really secure cryptography to the masses gee if the proposal was saying we guarantee that every american will still have the full right to use any kind of encryption s he would like and regard this proposal as just a default voluntary implementation there would have been much less opposition for some reason they didn t even try to promise you that i wonder why was orwell off only by years return we get access to high security crypto no in return you get crypto that is guaranteed to be crippled many have suggested that des and other systems may be breakable by the nsa and hence others similarly skilled and endowed while the above is just rumors and while even if it is true it is not done easily the new scheme can is guaranteed to be easily breakable by anybody who has the two keys it might be also breakable by somebody who does not have them but knows the right trick or who has only one of them nsa also told you that des is secure why don t you simply trust them huh there is at least a good possibility which should be checked that the proposed system is not so breakable it doesn t have to it is guaranteed to be easily breakable just get the keys it might be even easier but until there is some evidence this is just a wild speculation be nor does it have to have trapdoors if the government can get the keys the trapdoors are there in government s hands the keys pursuant to a legitimate court order thus they can protect legitimate communications against economic adversaries while still being able to eavesdrop on crooks pursuant to a court order legitimate and who decides what communications are legitimate oh i guess it s the government right the guys who already have the keys it s kinda if i have the keys from your car and i am asked to decide who has the right to use it legitimately in discussing this let s try to avoid the nastiness personal attacks and noise of some previous threads

sci.crypt	report on privacy protecting off line cash available i recently published a new privacy protecting off line electronic cash system as a technical report at cwi being a phd student at david chaum s cryptography group our group has a long history in research in the field of privacy protecting cash systems the report is called cs r ps z contains pages and can be retrieved from ftp cwi nl from the directory pub cwireports aa the postscript file is suitable for dpi laserprinters abstract from coverpage we present a new off line electronic cash system based on a problem called the representation problem of which little use has been made in literature thus far our system is the first to be based entirely on discrete logarithms using the representation problem as a basic concept some techniques are introduced that enable us to construct protocols for withdrawal and payment that do not use the cut and choose methodology of earlier systems as a consequence our cash system is much more efficient in both computation and communication complexity than any such system proposed previously another important aspect of our system concerns its provability contrary to previously proposed systems its correctness can be mathematically proven to a very great extent specifically if we make one plausible assumption concerning a single hash function the ability to break the system seems to imply that one can break the diffie hellman problem our system offers a number of extensions that are hard to achieve in previously known systems in our opinion the most interesting of these is that the entire cash system including all the extensions can be incorporated in a setting based on wallets with observers which has the important advantage that double spending can be prevented in the first place rather than detecting the identity of a double spender after the fact in particular it can be incorporated even under the most stringent requirements conceivable about the privacy of the user which seems to be impossible to do with previously proposed systems another benefit of our system is that framing attempts by a bank have negligible probability of success independent of computing power by a simple mechanism from within the system which is something that previous solutions lack entirely furthermore the basic cash system can be extended to checks multi show cash and divisibility while retaining its computational efficiency cryptographers are challenged to try to break this system i made a particular effort to keep the report as self contained as possible nevertheless if you have any questions please e mail to me and i will try to reply as good as i can any comments are also welcome stefan brands cwi kruislaan sj amsterdam the netherlands tel e mail brands cwi nl

sci.crypt	re more technical details hmm followup on my own posting well who cares first let me try to work out the facts that we get to know about the clipper chip from what hellman and denning were able to tell us the chip itself is not confined to digital telephony but performs general encryption in a symmetric manner the chip supports cfb ofb ecb and whatever the fourth mode of operation for des is the algorithm consists of rounds of whatever and takes bit keys input data seems to be bit yes so if two people want secure communication whatever that means when clipper is involved they have first to agree on one secret key or is it one key per direction they can exchange this key via dh schemes or however somehow the two feed their so won secret key into the clipper chip which is now ready to work the clipper chip carries an unique serial number bit s and key bits these key bits seem to have been gained by encrypting the serial number with seed bits the seed bits seem not to be stored in the chip at beginning of communication and perhaps at certain invtervals whithin before sending the fist real bit output of the first encryption the clipper chip put s out packets i guess which represent the serial number and the session key this might look like x e k chipkeyk k serial number where x is a transformation of these packets involving a family key this family sp key is equal for all chips x might be a simple xor after that the digital phone call can be done as usual every packet being encrypted and decrypted by clipper denning describes how k and k shall be generated using a seed of bit s now leaving alone politics which does not concern me as much as you not being an american citicien tm there are some weak points in this scheme which might be exploited by several parties as far as i know about the generation of k k s and s look like the obvious backdoor they could be used to generate the chip keys by knowing the serial number and also the family key of the chip i really can t imagine why these seeds would be needed otherwise as true random sources for the generation of the k k can be bought for not to much money then the escrows each of them will get bit of a bit key security could as little as existant be maximized by giving them bits each which have to be xored together to give the k k now let s simply assume the escrows are trustworthy and can t be fooled by criminals or law enforchemnt agencies and there will be no quarrel between escrows and l e a which would hinder the l e a in doing their duties and so on and so on once the keys are surrendered the corresponding chip is compromised forever not very clever imho how about sending in the encrypted session keys for each phone call that the police or whoever want s to listen to escrows could then simply decode this session key and send it back to police and would naturally not do this after the warrant has expired this would be a better technical solution but i guess politics will not work that way apparently as miss dennings stated the only one performing actually decodes of intercepted messages shall be the fbi great so local guys can not inter cept understand your traffic anymore does this mean that the fbi monopolizes the right to do legal wiretaps how is law over there i have no idea who is allowed to tap and who not this certainly means that watched communi cations will be routed automatically from the service providing company to the fbi if the communicaiton is a watched one and this means as far as i understand it that the family key has to be known by each switching company and those providing cellular phone servies etcetc so the family key will not be very secret and thus serial numbers of calls will be readable by anybody who cares i like traffic analysis what do you guess what happens if you use the chip in ecb mode and the first few packets of the chip are somehow lost or garbled so the session key would not be actually broadcasted over the line hmmm shouldn t be so difficult to do that and now a last point for the other side after all i have read and heard about clipper not the programming language for dbase is it it seems to have many advantages which shold not be overseen now an afterthought to your rights please note that i have no idea what i am talking about from grady netcom com ef amendment congress

gillogly trewesday astron s r thanks for posting this and making it available this post will be long i will comment on most of it and am reluctantly leaving all of the original in place to provide context please note that an alt group has been set up for the clipper stuff note this file will also be available via anonymous file transfer from csrc ncsl nist gov in directory pub nistnews and via the nist computer security bbs at the white house office of the press secretary for immediate release april statement by the press secretary the president today announced a new initiative that will bring the federal government together with industry in a voluntary hum at t vlsi and mykotronx are industry wonder what happened to ibm this should be right up their street and a mandateed scheme is voluntary mr orwell would love this program to improve the security and privacy of telephone communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement telephone encryption and scrambleing are years behind digital ones like rsa idea or even des the above while literaly true is a clasic straw man claim in the context of non real time circuits such as e mail and the like the initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links i would modestly propose that a mandated use of isdn would do more for commun ications than this lot for too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting americans rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth privacy and law enforcement previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer it is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files while encryption normmaly des technology can help americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information it also can be used by terrorists drug dealers and other criminals note the use of the word business in the above the whole tenor of this release seems to be establishing a ground rule that only business use is legitimate for debate if you want the nothings you drop in your wife s ear to remain secret and private that is not even on the agenda for debate note that there is no role for you to contain private info in this the only reference is to information already in the hands of others the unauthorized release bit is also drawing a long bow most of these cases are by people who have legitimate access abusing it and revealing or often selling the info these people are of course in this proposal the people who will have the keys the criminals also use lawers courts the cia white house officials and pens to go about their business when will they be outlawed as well yeah several of them would be a better idea than clipper them again the protections of law and the courts have been seriously erroded over the last decade ofr so a state of the art microcircuit called the clipper chip has been developed by government engineers the chip represents a nsa new approach to encryption technology yeah this bit is very true it can be used in new relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary telephone it scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today note the repeated mixing of telephone scrabeling and encryption a demo of the above claim on an ordanary pots would be a good nights entertainment i suspect note also the many not all as the general tone implies this new technology will help companies protect proprietary information protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically at the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals the case record seems to indicate that what is needed is a brutal tightening of the current abuses i have not heard yet of a case that was impeaded by the use of secure encryption by the men in black the other side abuse by law enforcers is well documented even by govt agencies and the phone vs other coms is blurred yet again a key escrow system will be established to ensure that the clipper chip is used to protect the privacy of law abiding americans a key escrow system will be established to ensure that the clipper chip is used to protect the privacy of law abiding americans lets run that line twice not very carefully what it says the stated purpose of the key eschrow is to make the use of clipper compulsory note the word ensure as to protect or law abiding i will leave to you so to the person who asked if it included the outlawing of other encryptions the answer in this press release is yes each device containing the chip will have two unique keys numbers that will be needed by authorized government agencies to decode messages encoded by the device when the device is manufactured the two keys will be deposited separately in two key escrow data bases that will be established by the attorney general access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap just as they only can wiretap now with a warrent the clipper chip technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of americans just makes sure that the illegal ones are preserved to demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology the attorney general will soon purchase several thousand of the new devices in addition respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings where do you find many experts any ex kgb people looking for a contract and as a later posting asks what of the stu iiis they already have it will be very interesting to see if the military and us embasies start to use it after all it is secure isn t it the govt will answer that point by its own actions the chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption s dual edge sword encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry but it also can shield criminals and terrorists we need the clipper chip and other approaches that can both provide law abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities in order to assess technology trends and explore new approaches like the key escrow system the president has directed government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates the privacy of our citizens including the need to employ voice or data encryption for business purposes again personal use seems to be a unaskable question the ability of authorized officials to access telephone calls and data under proper court or other legal order when necessary to protect our citizens ah so warrents are not always needed it seems the effective and timely use of the most modern technology to build the national information infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and the competitiveness of american industry in the global marketplace and the need of u s companies to manufacture and export high technology products the itars seem to slightly impeed this the president has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries the congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed the administration is committed to working with the private sector to spur the development of a national information infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies to give americans unprecedented access to information this infrastructure of high speed networks information superhighways will transmit video images hdtv programming and huge data files as easily as today s telephone system transmits voice note that all this wonderfull stuff will be in secret only the proper people will be able to express an opinion hence only the desired result will emerge since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure the federal government must act quickly to develop consistent comprehensive policies regarding its use the administration is committed to policies that protect all americans right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law encryption and codes have been around for millenia they are generaly in equilibrium with the technology of the time the systematic study of cyphers has resulted in a swing in favor of the encrypter at the moment i have no doubt that the factoring problem will fall in time probably fofr practical purposes by the middle of the next century further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet the provisions of the president s directive to acquire the new encryption technology are also available for additional details call mat heyman national institute of standards and technology questions and answers about the clinton administration s telecommunications initiative q does this approach expand the authority of government agencies to listen in on phone conversations a no clipper chip technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of americans q suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation encrypted using the device what would they have to do to decipher the message a they would have to obtain legal authorization normally a court order to do the wiretap in the first place they would then present documentation of this authorization to the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug smugglers the key is split into two parts which are stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key escrow system q who will run the key escrow data banks a the two key escrow data banks will be run by two independent entities at this point the department of justice and the administration have yet to determine which agencies will oversee the key escrow data banks it is a little hard to critisise a non proposal q how strong is the security in the device how can i be sure how strong the security is a this system is more secure than many other voice encryption systems readily available today note we drop back to phone mode again if this is a true answer it can be rephrased as it sucks big time anyone who can drive the crypt work bench will use it for light amusement before breakfast while the algorithm will remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow system this link between the security of the key eschrow and the actual algorithm is a real winner given that i have secret bit numbers could someone please explain how the details of an encryption algorithm will reveal them we are willing to invite an independent panel of cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all potential users that there are no unrecognized vulnerabilities just make sure you read the cvs real carfully ok q whose decision was it to propose this product a the national security council the justice department the commerce department and other key agencies were involved in this decision this approach has been endorsed by the president the vice president and appropriate cabinet officials quick with out looking back what name is missing from that list q who was consulted the congress industry a we have on going discussions with congress and industry on encryption issues and expect those discussions to intensify as we carry out our review of encryption policy we have briefed members of congress and industry leaders on the decisions related to this initiative the people who agree with us and who think there is a buck in it for them q will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers a the government designed and developed the key access encryption microcircuits but it is not providing the microcircuits to product manufacturers product manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip manufacturer that produces them the reverse engineering provisions of the mask work act could be relevent here q who provides the clipper chip a mykotronx programs it at their facility in torrance california and will sell the chip to encryption device manufacturers the programming function could be licensed to other vendors in the future q how do i buy one of these encryption devices a we expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating the clipper chip into their devices you don t not unless you are one of the right people q if the administration were unable to find a technological solution like the one proposed would the administration be willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more powerful encryption devices a this is a fundamental policy question which will be considered during the broad policy review the key escrow they missed the word secret here he needs a grammar lesson too mechanism will provide americans with an encryption product that is more secure more convenient and less expensive than others readily available today but it is just one piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to encryption technology which the administration is developing i would say less secure less conveniant more expensive pgp is free less available and more prone to being comprimised proofs to the contarary will be welcome note proof the administration is not saying since encryption threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement we will prohibit it outright as some countries have effectively done nor is the u s saying that every american as a matter of right is entitled to an unbreakable commercial encryption product they don t seem to be saying anything that makes much sense and this proposal does prohibit it except in a very limited way and this is the one explicit reference to personal rights it is a denial and yes i don t think that the mexicans brazilians and canucks are included in clinton et als magnanamous gesture there is a false tension created in the assessment that this issue is an either or proposition rather both concerns can be and in fact are harmoniously balanced through a reasoned balanced approach such as is proposed with the clipper chip and similar encryption techniques the false tension is false the balance is between two repugnant points the right to privacy is hand waved to non existance by putting it behind the false assessment it is assumed that the removal of the right to take what ever steps you deem suitable to protect your privacy is non negotiable hence is defined in the govenment language to be non existant if you don t agree you must be a criminal as only criminals don t agree with out laws also note the non question if what is here was not possible q what does this decision indicate about how the clinton administration s policy toward encryption will differ from that of the bush administration a it indicates that we understand the importance of encryption technology in telecommunications and computing and are committed to working with industry and public interest groups to find innovative ways to protect americans privacy help businesses to compete and ensure that law enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime and terrorism it indicates we know that bush dropped the ball in squashing that nasty insert suitable retoric and will stamp out this disorderly unruley outbreak of freedom and ultra national sentiment q will the devices be exportable will other devices that use the government hardware a voice encryption devices are subject to export control requirements case by case review for each export is required to ensure appropriate use of these devices the same is true for other encryption devices one of the attractions of this technology is the protection it can give to u s companies operating at home and abroad with this in mind we expect export licenses will be granted on a case by case basis for u s companies seeking to use these devices to secure their own communications abroad we plan to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability of these products this one is a real giggle in australia or france they will have to reveal the keys and the algorithm don t think it s at the top of my list of things i must have so the restrictions will protect me from saleks trying to sell me a bill of crock any for any others using it they must be nuts good luck folks paul

sci.crypt	the clipper chip a technical summary the following document summarizes the clipper chip how it is used how programming of the chip is coupled to key generation and the escrow process and how law enforcement decrypts communications since there has been some speculation on this news group about my own involvement in this project i d like to add that i was not in any way involved i found out about it when the fbi briefed me on thursday evening april since then i have spent considerable time talking with the nsa and fbi to learn more about this and i attended the nist briefing at the department of commerce on april the document below is the result of that effort dorothy denning the clipper chip a technical summary dorothy denning april introduction on april the president announced a new initiative that will bring together the federal government and industry in a voluntary program to provide secure communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement at the heart of the plan is a new tamper proof encryption chip called the clipper chip together with a split key approach to escrowing keys two escrow agencies are used and the key parts from both are needed to reconstruct a key chip structure the clipper chip contains a classified bit block encryption algorithm called skipjack the algorithm uses bit keys compared with for the des and has rounds of scrambling compared with for the des it supports all des modes of operation throughput is mbits a second each chip includes the following components the skipjack encryption algorithm f an bit family key that is common to all chips n a bit serial number u an bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip encrypting with the chip to see how the chip is used imagine that it is embedded in the at t telephone security device as it will be suppose i call someone and we both have such a device after pushing a button to start a secure conversation my security device will negotiate a session key k with the device at the other end in general any method of key exchange can be used the key k and message stream m i e digitized voice are then fed into the clipper chip to produce two values e m k the encrypted message stream and e e k u n f a law enforcement block the law enforcement block thus contains the session key k encrypted under the unit key u concatenated with the serial number n all encrypted under the family key f chip programming and escrow all clipper chips are programmed inside a scif secure computer information facility which is essentially a vault the scif contains a laptop computer and equipment to program the chips about chips are programmed during a single session the scif is located at mikotronx at the beginning of a session a trusted agent from each of the two key escrow agencies enters the vault agent enters an bit value s into the laptop and agent enters an bit value s these values serve as seeds to generate keys for a sequence of serial numbers to generate the unit key for a serial number n the bit value n is first padded with a fixed bit block to produce a bit block n s and s are then used as keys to triple encrypt n producing a bit block r r e d e n s s s similarly n is padded with two other bit blocks to produce n and n and two additional bit blocks r and r are computed r e d e n s s s r e d e n s s s r r and r are then concatenated together giving bits the first bits are assigned to u and the second bits to u the rest are discarded the unit key u is the xor of u and u u and u are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow agencies as a sequence of values for u u and u are generated they are written onto three separate floppy disks the first disk contains a file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part u the second disk is similar but contains the u values the third disk contains the unit keys u agent takes the first disk and agent takes the second disk the third disk is used to program the chips after the chips are programmed all information is discarded from the vault and the agents leave the laptop may be destroyed for additional assurance that no information is left behind the protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the room instead of two the first two would provide the seeds s and s and the second two the escrow agents would take the disks back to the escrow agencies the escrow agencies have as yet to be determined but they will not be the nsa cia fbi or any other law enforcement agency one or both may be independent from the government law enforcement use when law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line they will first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get access to the communications line let us assume that the tap is in place and that they have determined that the line is encrypted with clipper they will first decrypt the law enforcement block with the family key f this gives them e k u n they will then take a warrant identifying the chip serial number n to each of the key escrow agents and get back u and u u and u are xored together to produce the unit key u and e k u is decrypted to get the session key k finally the message stream is decrypted all this will be accomplished through a special black box decoder operated by the fbi acknowledgment and distribution notice all information is based on information provided by nsa nist and the fbi permission to distribute this document is granted

sci.crypt	clipper considered harmful if clipper comes to cellular phones along with legal proscriptions against using other cipher systems on these phones a new and potentially dangerous class of crime is created criminals who very badly want inscrutable tactical communications specifically the terrorists and drug dealers who proponents of key escrow cite as threats will be highly motivated to steal the cipher phone of a legitimate user and to kill this person or hold them hostage so discovery of compromise of the device will be delayed once a suitable collection of devices is stolen criminals can communicate with impunity assuming the cipher system carries no trapdoors apart from key escrow until and unless the compromise is discovered by some other means because life is cheap criminals are currently willing to kill people to steal very large and conspicuous property luxury cars it is reasonable to assume that they will be willing to kill people to steal small and inconspicuous property a cipher cellular phone just as we have seen in the past with blue box technology and in the present with modified cellular phones we can expect to see among high stakes criminals a lucrative market for stolen cipher phones which can be used for a few days the high stakes criminals will pay the life is cheap types substantial amounts for stolen instruments because a person is typically discovered as missing or dead in a few days a stolen instrument will be usable for only a few days there will be a continuing demand for fresh phones fresh bodies in other words clipper and similar systems have the potential to turn a current inconvenience to law enforcement into a direct vicious and persistent threat to the general public on the other hand if a criminal were to apply some arbitrary cipher to a device in a mostly non ciphered network the communication will at least stand out as being unusual and perhaps worthy of other means of investigation finally because there is essentially no possibility of intercepting in realtime the scrutable content of communications between stolen instruments there will exist strong motivation to record and archive all communications in the network for ex post facto scrutiny once some criminal act is discovered and the instruments involved have been identified while recording and archiving may not be feasible for wireline networks it is probably feasible across the more limited bandwidth of radio networks the existence of these recordings could open up vast potential for abuse brad yearwood brad optilink com uunet pyramid optilink brad petaluma ca

sci.crypt	another key registration body bites the dust imho one of the candidates that has been suggested for a key registration body is the aclu i think this is poor choice the aclu is essentially a group of auditors they audit how people s civil liberties are administered traditionally auditors do not like to get involved in the design or operational aspects of things and with good reason when i was a systems programmer it always infuriated me that the auditors would come in and tell us our implementation stunk from a security point of view but wouldn t tell us how to fix it i always figured they just liked to critcize without doing the work to help fix the problem then i took a stint as an auditor and i found out the real reason auditors don t like to recommend solutions because it puts them in a bad position if they have to criticize the implementation later the auditee can say well you told us this way would be ok it compromises the independence that is a necessary part of the auditor s job taking the case at hand suppose aclu becomes a key half registrar suppose that perhaps through some error on aclu s part a key half gets away that shouldn t and is used to deprive someone of her civil liberties the aclu gets wind of this and wants to take it to court but they end up being at the same time on the side of the defendant and of the plaintiff which is not an easy position to be in there are exceptions to the complete independence of auditors at one place where i worked when payroll checks were printed they were signed automatically by a signature drum on the bursting machine this drum was kept by the auditors who also kept the check stock and was brought down to data processing when it was time to do the checks i believe the difference between this situation and the key registration situation is that it is fairly obvious when it is time to do the payroll checks if they were done yesterday and someone wants to do them again today he better be able to produce yesterday s checks so that they can be destroyed determining which of the many requests for key halves are legit is a trickier process one much more prone to mistakes that could put the aclu in a protecting the client versus protecting the aclu conflict of interest as always my opinions are my own lynn grant grant dockmaster ncsc mil

sci.crypt	a little political philosophy worth reading read this through once or twice then replace prince with government or president as appropriate and read it again from chapter xx of the prince by n macchiavelli as translated by daniel donno in order to keep their lands secure some princes have disarmed their subjects others have prompted division within the cities they have subjugated some have nurtured animosities against themselves others have sought to win the approval of those they initially distrusted some have erected fortresses others have destroyed them now although it is impossible to set down definite judgements on all of these measures without considering the particular circumstances of the states where they may be employed i shall nevertheless discuss them in such broad terms as the subject itself will allow to begin with there has never been a case of a new prince disarming his subjects indeed whenever he found them disarmed he proceeded to arm them for by arming your subjects you make their arms your own those among them who are suspicious become loyal while those who are already loyal remain so and from subjects they are transformed into partisans though you cannot arm them all nonetheless you increase your safety among those you leave unarmed by extending privileges to those you arm your different treatment of the two categories will make the latter feel obligated to you while the former will consider it proper thoat those who assume added duties and dangers should receive advantages when you disarm your subjects however you offend them by showing that either from cowardliness or from lack of faith you distrust them and either conclusion will induce them to hate you moreover since it is impossible for you to remain unarmed you would have to resort to mercenaries whose limitations have already been discussed even if such troops were good however they could never be good enough to defend you from powerful enemies and doubtful subjects therefore as i have said a new prince in a newly acquired state has always taken measures to arm his subjects and history is full of examples proving that this is so but when a prince takes posession of a new state which he annexes as an addition to his original domain then he must disarm all the subjects of the new state except those who helped him to acquire it and these as time and occasion permit he must seek to render soft and weak he must arrange matters in such a way that the arms of the entire state will be in the hands of soldiers who are native to his original domain and since the subject demands it i will not fail to remind any prince who has acquired a new state by the aid of its inhabitants that he soundly consider what induced them to assist him if the reason is not natural affection for him but rather dissatisfaction with the former government he will find it extremely difficult to keep them friendly for it will be impossible to please them if he will carefully think the matter through in the light of examples drawn from ancient and modern affairs he will understand why it is much easier to win the favor of those who were happy with their former government and hence were his enemies than to keep the favor of those who out of dissatisfaction with the former rule helped him to replace it

part of the constitution and interpreted it in context if not please do so before posting this misinterpretation again it refers to the right of the people to organize a militia not for individuals to carry handguns grenades and assault rifles read it again yourself then re apply the admonition you gave to the previous poster to yourself as well the first clause is not a condition it is a reason for explicitly supporting the right which exists militia or not that the people have a right to keep and bear arms this is not a right granted by the constitution it is a right presumed to exist by default the constitution mentioning a right is to prevent the government from removing that right by stating very clearly the government shall not infringe mess with block limit that right remember the constitution is a bunch of negative things things the government cannot do all rights etc not epxressly given to the government go to the states and the people the same people the other amendments in the bill of rights talk about since i am sure you will summarily reject my interpretation i am appending a linguistic analysis by one far more expert than myself and you i suspect i am sure you will find his qualifications adequate if that isn t enough i can send you the senate subcommitee to the judiciary on the constitution report on the same thing there are some things in there that big brother types like biden etc must have really had to swallow hard to admit i think you will find that people that seriously study the constitution and state what it means will say the same thing those who come up with new improved meanings are those who are trying to subvert the constitution for a given agenda like clinton and his clinton cripple gun control people control and control control and the whole nasty mess please tell us how this person is in error won t you and please back it up with some proof since i am backing my assertion up with independent proof and have a bunch more i can

and if you wanted to know about desert warfare the man to call would be norman schwarzkopf no question about it but who would you call if you wanted the top expert on american usage to tell you the meaning of the second amendment to the united states constitution that was the question i asked a c brocki editorial coordinator of the los angeles unified school district and formerly senior editor at houghton mifflin publishers who himself had been recommended to me as the foremost expert on english usage in the los angeles school system mr brocki told me to get in touch with roy copperud a retired professor journalism at the university of southern california and the author of american usage and style the consensus a little research lent support to brocki s opinion of professor copperud s expertise roy copperud was a newspaper writer on major dailies for over three decades before embarking on a a distinguished year career teaching journalism at usc since copperud has been writing a column dealing with the professional aspects of journalism for editor and publisher a weekly magazine focusing on the journalism field he s on the usage panel of the american heritage dictionary and merriam webster s usage dictionary frequently cites him as an expert copperud s fifth book on usage american usage and style the consensus has been in continuous print from van nostrand reinhold since and is the winner of the association of american publisher s humanities award that sounds like an expert to me after a brief telephone call to professor copperud in which i introduced myself but did not give him any indication of why i was interested i sent the following letter i am writing you to ask you for your professional opinion as an expert in english usage to analyze the text of the second amendment to the united states constitution and extract the intent from the text the text of the second amendment is a well regulated militia being necessary for the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed the debate over this amendment has been whether the first part of the sentence a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state is a restrictive clause or a subordinate clause with respect to the independent clause containing the subject of the sentence the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed i would request that your analysis of this sentence not take into consideration issues of political impact or public policy but be restricted entirely to a linguistic analysis of its meaning and intent further since your professional analysis will likely become part of litigation regarding the consequences of the second amendment i ask that whatever analysis you make be a professional opinion that you would be willing to stand behind with your reputation and even be willing to testify under oath to support if necessary my letter framed several questions about the test of the second amendment then concluded i realize that i am asking you to take on a major responsibility and task with this letter i am doing so because as a citizen i believe it is vitally important to extract the actual meaning of the second amendment while i ask that your analysis not be affected by the political importance of its results i ask that you do this because of that importance after several more letters and phone calls in which we discussed terms for his doing such an analysis but in which we never discussed either of our opinions regarding the second amendment gun control or any other political subject professor copperud sent me the follow analysis into which i have inserted my questions for the sake of clarity copperud the words a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state contrary to the interpretation cited in your letter of july constitutes a present participle rather than a clause it is used as an adjective modifying militia which is followed by the main clause of the sentence subject the right verb shall the to keep and bear arms is asserted as an essential for maintaining a militia in reply to your numbered questions schulman can the sentence be interpreted to grant the right to keep and bear arms solely to a well regulated militia copperud the sentence does not restrict the right to keep and bear arms nor does it state or imply possession of the right elsewhere or by others than the people it simply makes a positive statement with respect to a right of the people schulman is the right of the people to keep and bear arms granted by the words of the second amendment or does the second amendment assume a preexisting right of the people to keep and bear arms and merely state that such right shall not be infringed copperud the right is not granted by the amendment its existence is assumed the thrust of the sentence is that the right shall be preserved inviolate for the sake of ensuring a militia schulman is the right of the people to keep and bear arms conditioned upon whether or not a well regulated militia is in fact necessary to the security of a free state and if that condition is not existing is the statement the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed null and void copperud no such condition is expressed or implied the right to keep and bear arms is not said by the amendment to depend on the existence of a militia no condition is stated or implied as to the relation of the right to keep and bear arms and to the necessity of a well regulated militia as a requisite to the security of a free state the right to keep and bear arms is deemed unconditional by the entire sentence schulman does the clause a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state grant a right to the government to place conditions on the right of the people to keep and bear arms or is such right deemed unconditional by the meaning of the entire sentence copperud the right is assumed to exist and to be unconditional as previously stated it is invoked here specifically for the sake of the militia schulman which of the following does the phrase well regulated militia mean well equipped well organized well drilled well educated or subject to regulations of a superior authority copperud the phrase means subject to regulations of a superior authority this accords with the desire of the writers for civilian control over the military schulman if at all possible i would ask you to take account the changed meanings of words or usage since that sentence was written years ago but not take into account historical interpretations of the intents of the authors unless those issues can be clearly separated copperud to the best of my knowledge there has been no change in the meaning of words or in usage that would affect the meaning of the amendment if it were written today it might be put since a well regulated militia is necessary tot he security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be abridged schulman as a scientific control on this analysis i would also appreciate it if you could compare your analysis of the text of the second amendment to the following sentence a well schooled electorate being necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and read books shall not be infringed my questions for the usage analysis of this sentence would be is the grammatical structure and usage of this sentence and the way the words modify each other identical to the second amendment s sentence and could this sentence be interpreted to restrict the right of the people to keep and read books only to a well educated electorate for example registered voters with a high school diploma copperud your scientific control sentence precisely parallels the amendment in grammatical structure there is nothing in your sentence that either indicates or implies the possibility of a restricted interpretation professor copperud had only one additional comment which he placed in his cover letter with well known human curiosity i made some speculative efforts to decide how the material might be used but was unable to reach any conclusion so now we have been told by one of the top experts on american usage what many knew all along the constitution of the united states unconditionally protects the people s right to keep and bear arms forbidding all governments formed under the constitution from abridging that right as i write this the attempted coup against constitutional government in the soviet union has failed apparently because the will of the people in that part of the world to be free from capricious tyranny is stronger than the old guard s desire to maintain a monopoly on dictatorial power and here in the united states elected lawmakers judges and appointed officials who are pledged to defend the constitution of the united states ignore marginalize or prevaricate about the second amendment routinely american citizens are put in american prisons for carrying arms owning arms of forbidden sorts or failing to satisfy bureaucratic requirements regarding the owning and carrying of firearms all of which is an abridgement of the unconditional right of the people to keep and bear arms guaranteed by the constitution and even the american civil liberties union aclu staunch defender of the rest of the bill of rights stands by and does nothing it seems it is up to those who believe in the right to keep and bear arms to preserve that right no one else will no one else can will we beg our elected representatives not to take away our rights and continue regarding them as representing us if they do will we continue obeying judges who decide that the second amendment doesn t mean what it says it means but means whatever they say it means in their orwellian doublespeak or will be simply keep and bear the arms of our choice as the constitution of the united states promises us we can and pledge that we will defend that promise with our lives our fortuned and our sacred honor c by the new gun week and second

technical summary dorothy denning revised april introduction on april the president announced a new initiative that will bring together the federal government and industry in a voluntary program to provide secure communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement at the heart of the plan is a new tamper proof encryption chip called the clipper chip together with a split key approach to escrowing keys two escrow agencies are used and the key parts from both are needed to reconstruct a key chip contents the clipper chip contains a classified single key bit block encryption algorithm called skipjack the algorithm uses bit keys compared with for the des and has rounds of scrambling compared with for the des it supports all des modes of operation the algorithm takes clock ticks and in electronic codebook ecb mode runs at mbits per second each chip includes the following components the skipjack encryption algorithm f an bit family key that is common to all chips n a bit serial number this length is subject to change u an bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip the chips are programmed by mykotronx inc which calls them the myk the silicon is supplied by vlsi technology inc they are implemented in micron technology and will initially sell for about each in quantities of or more the price should drop as the technology is shrunk to micron encrypting with the chip to see how the chip is used imagine that it is embedded in the at t telephone security device as it will be suppose i call someone and we both have such a device after pushing a button to start a secure conversation my security device will negotiate an bit session key k with the device at the other end this key negotiation takes place without the clipper chip in general any method of key exchange can be used such as the diffie hellman public key distribution method once the session key k is established the clipper chip is used to encrypt the conversation or message stream m digitized voice the telephone security device feeds k and m into the chip to produce two values e m k the encrypted message stream and e e k u n f a law enforcement field which are transmitted over the telephone line the law enforcement field thus contains the session key k encrypted under the unit key u concatenated with the serial number n all encrypted under the family key f the law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after an authorized wiretap has been installed the ciphertext e m k is decrypted by the receiver s device using the session key d e m k k m chip programming and escrow all clipper chips are programmed inside a scif secure compartmented information facility which is essentially a vault the scif contains a laptop computer and equipment to program the chips about chips are programmed during a single session the scif is located at mykotronx at the beginning of a session a trusted agent from each of the two key escrow agencies enters the vault agent enters a secret random bit value s into the laptop and agent enters a secret random bit value s these random values serve as seeds to generate unit keys for a sequence of serial numbers thus the unit keys are a function of secret random bits where each agent knows only to generate the unit key for a serial number n the bit value n is first padded with a fixed bit block to produce a bit block n s and s are then used as keys to triple encrypt n producing a bit block r r e d e n s s s similarly n is padded with two other bit blocks to produce n and n and two additional bit blocks r and r are computed r e d e n s s s r e d e n s s s r r and r are then concatenated together giving bits the first bits are assigned to u and the second bits to u the rest are discarded the unit key u is the xor of u and u u and u are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow agencies as a sequence of values for u u and u are generated they are written onto three separate floppy disks the first disk contains a file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part u the second disk is similar but contains the u values the third disk contains the unit keys u agent takes the first disk and agent takes the second disk thus each agent walks away knowing an bit seed and the bit key parts however the agent does not know the other bits used to generate the keys or the other bit key parts the third disk is used to program the chips after the chips are programmed all information is discarded from the vault and the agents leave the laptop may be destroyed for additional assurance that no information is left behind the protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the room instead of two the first two would provide the seeds s and s and the second two the escrow agents would take the disks back to the escrow agencies the escrow agencies have as yet to be determined but they will not be the nsa cia fbi or any other law enforcement agency one or both may be independent from the government law enforcement use when law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line they will first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get access to the communications line let us assume that the tap is in place and that they have determined that the line is encrypted with the clipper chip the law enforcement field is first decrypted with the family key f giving e k u n documentation certifying that a tap has been authorized for the party associated with serial number n is then sent e g via secure fax to each of the key escrow agents who return e g also via secure fax u and u u and u are xored together to produce the unit key u and e k u is decrypted to get the session key k finally the message stream is decrypted all this will be accomplished through a special black box decoder capstone the next generation a successor to the clipper chip called capstone by the government and myk by mykotronx has already been developed it will include the skipjack algorithm the digital signature standard dss the secure hash algorithm sha a method of key exchange a fast exponentiator and a randomizer a

sci.crypt	re secret algorithm re clipper chip and crypto key escrow after reading the debate over the clipper i have a few things to add first most of the people i know who activly use encryption privately do not care about most of the issues that surround this debate and any questions about what is or is not ok to use in the us all they care about is wether or not what they are using is secure or not that after all is the bottom line second if i look at all the people i know who use any form of encryption at all and this group spans people from the morons who still insist that the des is a good and secure standard to people looking at trying to improve upon existing strategies i can not think of anyone of them who would approve blindly of a strategy that leaves their methods open to abuse the clipper does this because people make mistakes by nature and the us government is made up of people who are just as vulnerable to mistakes as everyone else third since most of the people i know are at least marginaly familiar with the vulnerabilities present in current software encryption stratigies i can t see how most of them are going to blindly trust that someone will not figure out a good way to compromise the clipper chip that despite any strengths or weaknesses that may exist in it so i can not see a high degree of confidence developing in the chip fourth when it comes to criminal abuse sure there are many stupid people out there and yes some will be open to being caught via the built in back door of the clipper chip however anyone who is going to do any serious investigation of how best to secure their data is going to run into that problem pretty damned fast and i would assume start looking around for other easily obtainible methods of encryption if nothing else were avalible none of this would be an issue however the truth is that most private encryption users that i ve ever run into simply do not give a damn about the legal status of rsa or pgp or anything else if it works they use it this is not going to change either i do not think for a moment that anyone with serious criminal intent will be slowed down by the advent of the clipper chip it is all to easy to convert encrypted data into unintellgible garbage as it is if anything the clipper chip just adds another tool to the user the bottom line here is that people will use what works and unavoidibly i m sure most criminals would rather face an encryption related charge than one which could potentialy lead to death penalty charges in the case of criminals who murder as part of their conspiricy the other thing that has struck me since the advent and wide useage of public encryption has begun is that quite simply the cat is out of the bag or if you have an interest in snooping pandora s box has been opened and this is not going to change i ve seen a blindness to this that i ve found utterly stunning and the clipper chip along with the way it has been presented only confirms this to me to a larger degree sincerly tim scanlon tfs gravity gmu edu

sci.crypt	will feds troll for mutilated law enforcement blocks from denning the skipjack encryption algorithm f an bit family key that is common to all chips n a bit serial number u an bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip e m k the encrypted message stream and e e k u n f a law enforcement block where the session key is k and is transmitted encrypted in the unit key u which along with the serial number n is encrypted in the family key f presumably the protocol can be recovered if by nothing else differential analysis postulate if you will a chip or logic sitting between the clipper chip and its communications channel the function of this spoof chip is twofold transmit channel the spoof chip xors the bit encrypted serial number with a secondary keying variable this renders the serial number unrecoverable with just the family key receive channel the spoof chip xors the incoming encrypted serial number with a secondary keying variable assuming integrity of the law enforcement block is necessary for local operation checksums sequence control etc this has the net result of hiding the serial number it is probable theere is a known plaintext pattern used as a filler in the block containing n bits as used in generating u u u correctness of the law enforcement block can be determined with only the family key f whereas no one has proposed federal agencies be denied f and because they could recover it themselves the correctness of the serial number can be tested by examining the pad bits of n in e n f the one could selectively alter the law enforcement block as above but the mutilation could be detected a better approach would be to mutilate the entire law enforcement block if it were done with a group encryption scheme such as des or presumably skipjack the chances the law enforcement block can be recovered are lessened what do you want to bet the transmission protocol can be recognized and the serial numbers decrypted in a target search when digital transmission becomes widely available would there be a requirement that clipper protocol transmissions be refused when containing mutilated law enforcement blocks one way to avoid notice would be to spoof protocol information of the block containing m as well as spoofing the law enforcement block the goal is to use a secure communications scheme without redress to detection or key k interception contained encrypted within the law enforcement block the data stream is returned to its original state for use by the clipper chip or system if required for proper operation it is somewhat improbable that the entire protocol will be contained within the clipper chip yet likely that sequence of events will be tested for requiring a valid law enforcement block to be received before accepting and decrypting e m k the spoof chip could be implemented anywhere in the protocols including on the resulting serial data stream existing clipper products could be subborned after all they are high security encryption systems right super encipherment encryption could allow the chip to be used without redress to detection of the use of the chip or disclosure of the serial number security must be adequate to deny the serial number which should not be recoverable by other means one can see the use of cut outs for procurring clipper phones or once the number of units is high enough stealing them it would be a mistake on the part of authority but nice from a point of privacy if the serial number n were not associated with a particular clipper chip or lot of chips through the manufacturing and distribution process hopefully the list of known missing or stolen clipper serial numbers n encrypted with f and the protocols are not sufficient plaintext to attact the super encrypted clipper stream this could be further made difficult by altering the temporal and or spatial relationship of the clipper stream to that of the super encrypted stream detection of an encrypted stream could tip off the use of the aforementioned scheme if you could capture valid law enforcement blocks not your own and use them in a codebook sustitution with your own where they point to a valid law enforcement block stored in a library utilizing a session key matching the remainder of the transmission you could simply out and out lie yet deliver to monitoring and or hostile forces a seemingly valid law enforcement block these captured law enforcement blocks would be used as authenticators such as in a manually keyed encryption system fending this off would require escalation in examining the protocols and blocks in the transmission the m code stream might be independently attacked based on knowledge of clipper chip protocols as revealed plaintext this could be invalidated by changing the temporal and or spatial relationship of the clipper m stream and the actual transmitted stream under the control of a secure key generator synchronized between endpoints the useful life time of captured law enforcement blocks might be limited based on hostile forces using them as targets following transmission interception you would need a large number of them but hey there s supposed to be millions of these things right adding time stamps to the encrypted law enforcement block is probably impractical who wants an encryption chip with a real time clock the entire idea of the law enforcement block can be invalidated

sci.crypt	political point of attack clipper infrastructure my earlier argument that clipper will encourage state and local cops to commit criminal acts is largely moot now that we ve learned that the fbi will perform the actual tap it will encourage the fbi to commit even more criminal acts but that s not the point here but this gives another avenue of attack on the clipper proposal when the eff aclu cpsr foia requests are made they should ask for details on the bureaucratic and equipment infrastructure that is proposed or even already budgeted for the fbi to service tapping requests for now and the projected future from these figures estimate the number of clipper tap requests the fbi is expecting publish this figure compare it on a per capita basis with the amount of tapping now known or suspected also estimate how expensive it would be for the fbi to install more clipper tapping stations and how rapidly they could be built and installed ie get the plus or minus epsilon for the near future might be a mite disturbing for j q public to know these things and despite all the technical details btw thanks to those who ve been providing them we still don t know how the tapping requests will be transmitted and authenticated though it isn t too hard to guess a good scheme how the results will be securely transmitted fed ex the audio tapes how privacy will be re established when an investigation is complete dwight tuinstra best tuinstra sandman ece clarkson edu tolerable tuinstrd craft camp clarkson edu homo sapiens planetary cancer news at six

sci.electronics	re help with ultra long timing thanks for the resposes as they were all good ideas and i am looking at using a couple of the ideas i recieved in the mail today the spec sheets on the mil spec version of exar s xr timer counter chip it is stable down to c and sucks very little power they show an application for a ultra long time delay up to several years depending on the rc time constant in this application they have two of them cascaded together the reset and trigger pins of both chips are tied together and the timebase of the second chip is disabled in this configuration the output is high when the system is reset when triggered the output goes low and stays that way for a total of x the timing cycle of the first chip the total timing cycle of the two chips can be programmed from to x r x c to x r x c in steps by selecting any combination of the counter outputs to the timer output the beauty of it is the timebase chip would only have to have a uf timing cap and a k resistor for seconds per timing cycle so i can get a maximum of seconds between timing cycles x or about days of course that s much more than i need days but the counter allows for binary steps that can be selected for the output for the pellet puker after the first days and it trips it would reset its self for the next day timing cycle and so forth power is still a problem though a few ideas that you suggested was to bury the electronics in a hole dug in the snow as an insulator and put the pellet puker up on a tower above the estimated snow fall with a solar panel on it to keep a charge on a lithium battery pack i like that idea this thing has to work for at least six weeks for three samples and the gas valves are volts to spit the pellets out onto the snow anyway i ordered the xr s to see what i can do with them should be interesting as long as i m not the one that has to go digging up the pellets in the middle of antartica freezing my buns off thanks again everyone wes

sci.electronics	re uninterruptible power supply i m no expert at ups s but you said something that made it sound like you didn t realize something on a typical ups well on ours anyway there is no switchover from ac to dc all the protected equipment is always running from the batteries via an inverter with the usual condition of also having them on charge if the power fails big deal the computers never see it until the batteries start to droop but there s something like car sized batteries in that cabinet so it takes a while if you were gonna run the guts on straight dc instead of an inverter why not do it all the time then there d be no switchover to screw things up and no having to sense the failure fast just keep the dc on charge when the power is on and it ll be there in zero time when you need it just some ideas can t guarantee what ll work or not but hope at least some of this helped

sci.electronics	re uninterruptible power supply in article qk inn hp col col hp com cab col hp com chris best writes i m no expert at ups s but you said something that made it sound like you didn t realize something on a typical ups well on ours anyway there is no switchover from ac to dc all the protected equipment is always running from the batteries via an inverter with the usual condition of also having them on charge if the power fails big deal the computers never see it until the batteries start to droop but there s something like car sized batteries in that cabinet so it takes a while if you were gonna run the guts on straight dc instead of an inverter why not do it all the time then there d be no switchover to screw things up and no having to sense the failure fast just keep the dc on charge when the power is on and it ll be there in zero time when you need it actually it s a bit more complicated than that i sounds to me your ups takes in ac rectifies it to dc to charge the batteries and then takes the battery dc and chops it to ac again feeding your equipment this approach is the easiest and cleanest way to switchover from the mains to battery once your power kicks out since as you mentioned nothing will know about what happened down the line another way to do the ups scheme is to use the mains until you lose power and then kick in the battery backup with it s inverter to replace the lost power the problem here is the switchover time and you ve got to resync the ac in no time flat unfortunately most everything is built around the assumption that ac is available so the ups guys have to provide and ac output to be usable ya sorta have to make it work with what there already similar story with our telephone system it was first invented back in the s we re still using the same damn system media as they did back then if i have a phone from back then i can assure you it ll work on today s phone system it costs too much to overhaul everyone to a new system so they make it work with what is out there

wiring where do i buy stuff subject introduction disclaimers although we ve done a fair bit of wiring we are not electricians and we cannot be responsible for what you do if you re at all uncertain about what is correct or safe don t do it contact someone qualified a licensed electrician or your local electrical inspector electricity is no joke mistakes can result in shocks fires or electrocution furthermore our discussion is based on the u s national electrical code nec and the canadian electrical code cec to the best of our abilities we have confirmed every detail with the electrical code but we don t quote sections simply to keep this thing readable if you think we re wrong we invite you to correct us but please quote references the nec and the cec do not in and of themselves have the force of law many municipalities adopt it en toto others however do not check your with your local building department and provincial hydro inspection offices in canada to find out what applies in your area also your local electrical utility may also have special requirements for electrical service installation bear in mind too that we say here applies primarily to ordinary single family residences multi family dwellings mobile homes commercial establishments etc are sometimes governed by different rules also note that contrary to popular belief in the u s and in some parts of canada canada is not a wholly owned subsidiary of the u s consequently the nec does not apply in canada lots of things are the same including voltages line frequencies and the laws of physics but there are a number of crucial differences in the regulations where we can we ve noted them flagging the relevant passages with nec or cec remember that the cec and nec are minimal standards it is often smart to go beyond their minimal requirements subject what is the nec where can i get a copy the nec is a model electrical code devised and published by the national fire protection association an insurance industry group it s revised every three years the version has been released you can buy a copy at a decent bookstore or by calling them directly at the code exists in several versions there s the full text which is fairly incomprehensible there s an abridged edition which has only the sections likely to apply to most houses and there s the nec handbook which contains the authorized commentary on the code as well as the full text that s the recommended version unfortunately there s no handbook for the abridged edition and the full handbook is expensive us plus shipping and handling subject what is the cec where can i get a copy the canadian standards association is an organization made up of various government agencies power utilities insurance companies electrical manufacturers and other organizations the csa publishes csa standard c which is updated every two or three years each province adopts with some amendments this standard and publishes a province specific code book since each province publishes its own slightly modified standard it would be somewhat confusing to obtain the csa standard itself in this faq cec really means the appropriate provincial standard in particular this faq is derived from the ontario hydro electrical safety code th edition which is in turn based on csa c th edition while differences exist between the provinces an attempt has been made to avoid specific to ontario detail the appropriate provincial code can be obtained from electrical inspection offices of your provincial power authority in ontario it s ontario hydro the ontario hydro book isn t overly fat it s about c and includes mailed updates i hear that these standards are somewhat easier to read than the equivalent nec publications don t bother asking in quebec diy wiring is banned throughout the province subject can i do my own wiring extra pointers in most places homeowners are allowed to do their own wiring in some they re not check with your local electrical inspector most places won t permit you to do wiring on other s homes for money without a license nor are you permitted to do wiring in commercial buildings multiple dwellings eg duplexes are usually considered semi commercial or commercial however many jurisdictions will permit you to work on semi commercial wiring if you re supervised by a licensed electrician if you can find one willing to supervise if you do your own wiring an important point do it neat and well what you really want to aim for is a better job than an electrician will do after all it s your own home and it s you or your family that might get killed if you make a mistake an electrician has time pressures has the skills and knows the tricks of the trade to do a fast safe job in this faq we ve consciously given a few recommendations that are in excess of code because we feel that it s reasonable and will impress the inspector the inspector will know that you re an amateur you have to earn his trust the best way of doing this is to spend your time doing as neat a job as possible don t cut corners exceed specifications otherwise the inspector may get extremely picky and fault you on the slightest transgressions don t try to hide anything from the inspector use the proper tools ie don t use a bread knife to strip wires or twist wires with your fingers the inspector won t like it and the results won t be that safe and it takes longer and you re more likely to stick a hunk of ga wire through your hand that way don t handle house wire when it s very cold eg below c or f thermoplastic house wire particularly older types become very brittle subject what do i need in the way of tools first there s the obvious a hammer a drill a few screwdrivers both straight and phillips head if you re lucky enough to live in canada or find a source of csa approved devices you need robertson square recess screwdrivers and instead of phillips for drilling a few holes a or spade bit and or electric drill will do if you re doing a lot or are working with elderly lumber we recommend a drill right angle drills are wonderful can be rented and or screw point auger drill bits these bits pull you through so they re much faster and less fatiguing even in year old hardwood timbers screw driver bits are useful for drills expecially if you install your electrical boxes using screws drywall screws work well for stripping wire use a real wire stripper not a knife or ordinary wire cutters don t buy the k mart combo stripper crimper and bottle opener types you should expect to pay to for a good plier type pair it will have sized stripping holes and won t nick or grab the wire it should be easy to strip wire with it one model has a small hole in the blade for forming exact wire loops for screw terminals there are fancier types autostrip cut but they generally aren t necessary and pros usually don t use them a pair of diagonal side cutter pliers are useful for clipping ends in constricted places don t use these for stripping wire you will need linesman pliers for twisting wires for wire nuts you should have a pair of needle nose pliers for fiddling inside boxes and closing loops but it s better to form wire loops with a loop former hole on your wire stripper more accurate if you re using non metallic cable get a cable stripper for removing the sheath or do what some pros do they nick the end of the sheath grab the ground wire with a pair of pliers and simply rip the sheath back using the ground wire as a zipper and cut the sheath off you shouldn t try to strip the sheath with a knife point because it s too easy to slash the insulation on the conductors apparently stanley utility knives fitted with linoleum cutters hooked blades can be used to strip sheath but there is still the possibility that you ll gouge the conductors for any substantial amount of work with armored cable it s well worth your while to invest in a rotary cable splitter us hack saws are tricky to use without cutting into the wire or the insulation three prong outlet testers are a quick check for properly wired outlets about multimeters tell you more but are a lot more expensive and probably not worth it for most people a simple voltage sensor which can detect potential through an insulated wire not supplying any devices is extremely helpful they cost about us at radio shack you should have a voltage detector to check that the wires are dead before doing work on them neon bulb version are cheap and work well if you get more serious a audible alarm type is good for tracing circuits without a helper though i ve been known to lock the drill on and hit breakers until the scream stops for running wires through existing walls you need fish tape often two tapes are needed though sometimes a bent hanger or a length of thin chain will suffice fish tapes can be rented electrical tape lots of it seriously a good and competent wiring job will need very little tape the tape is useful for wrapping dicy insulation in repair work another use is to wrap around the body of outlets and switches to cover the termination screws i don t do this but drywall contractors prefer it to prevent explosions when the drywall knife collides with a live outlet that has no cover plate subject what is ul listing the ul stands for underwriters laboratory it used to be an insurance industry organization but now it is independent and non profit it tests electrical components and equipment for potential hazards when something is ul listed that means that the ul has tested the device and it meets their requirements for safety ie fire or shock hazard it doesn t necessarily mean that the device actually does what it s supposed to just that it probably won t kill you the ul does not have power of law in the u s you are permitted to buy and install non ul listed devices however insurance policies sometimes have clauses in them that will limit their liability in case of a claim made in response to the failure of a non ul listed device furthermore in many situations the nec will require that a wiring component used for a specific purpose is ul listed for that purpose indirectly this means that certain parts of your wiring must be ul listed before an inspector will approve it and or occupancy permits issued subject what is csa approval every electrical device or component must be certified by the canadian standards association before it can be sold in canada implicit in this is that all wiring must be done with csa approved materials they perform testing similar to the ul a bit more stringent except that csa approval is required by law again like the ul if a fire was caused by non csa approved equipment your insurance company may not have to pay the claim in canada there is a branch organization of the ul called ulc ul of canada ulc does not have power of law and seems to be more a liason group between the csa and insurance companies subject are there any cheaper easier to read books on wiring usa the following three books were suggested by our readers residential wiring by jeff markell craftsman books carlsbad ca for isbn practical electrical wiring residential farm and industrial based on the national electrical code ansi nfpa herbert p richter and w creighton schwan mcgraw hill book co wiring simplified h p richter and w c schwan park publishing co try to make sure that the book is based on the latest nec revision which is currently canada p s knight authors and publishes a book called electrical code simplified there appears to be a version published specific to each province and is very tied into the appropriate provincial code it focuses on residential wiring and is indispensible for canadian diy ers it is better to get this book than the cec unless you do a lot of wiring or answer questions on the net it is updated each time the provincial codes are this book is available at all diy and hardware stores for less than c subject inspections how and what why should i get my wiring inspected most jurisdictions require that you obtain a permit and inspections of any wiring that is done amongst other more mundane bureaucratic reasons like insurance companies not liking to have to pay claims a permit and inspections provides some assurance that you your family your neighbors or subsequent owners of your home don t get killed or lose their homes one night due to a sloppy wiring job most jurisdictions have the power to order you to vacate your home or order you to tear out any wiring done without a permit california for instance is particularly nasty about this if fire starts in your home and un inspected wiring is at fault insurance companies will often refuse to pay the damage claims in general the process goes like this you apply to your local inspections office or building department for a permit you should have a sketch or detailed drawing of what you plan on doing this is a good time to ask questions on any things you re not sure of if you re doing major work they may impose special conditions on you require loading calculations and ask other questions at this point they will tell you which inspections you will need if you re installing a main panel you will need to have the panel and service connections inspected before your power utility will provide a connection this is sometimes done by the local power authority rather than the usual inspectors after installing the boxes and wiring but before the insulation walls go up you will need a rough in inspection after the walls are up and the wiring is complete you will need a final inspection subject my house doesn t meet some of these rules and regulations do i have to upgrade in general there is no requirement to upgrade older dwellings though there are some exceptions ie smoke detectors in some cases however any new work must be done according to the latest electrical code also if you do major work you may be required to upgrade certain existing portions or all of your system check with your local electrical inspector subject a word on voltages one thing where things might get a bit confusing is the different numbers people bandy about for the voltage of a circuit one person might talk about v another v or another v these are all in fact exactly the same thing in north america the utility companies are required to supply a split phase volt feed to your house this works out as two v legs additionally since there are resistive voltage drops in the house wiring it s not unreasonable to find v has dropped to v or v has dropped to v by the time the power reaches a wall outlet especially at the end of an extension cord or long circuit run for a number of reasons some historical some simple personal orneryness different people choose call them by slightly different numbers this faq has chosen to be consistent with calling them v and v except when actually saying what the measured voltage will be confusing a bit just ignore it one thing that might make this a little more understandable is that the nameplates on equipment ofen show the lower ie v instead of v value what this implies is that the device is designed to operate properly when the voltage drops that low v is not the same as v v is the voltage between phases of a phase y circuit that is v from neutral to any hot v is the voltage between phases of a phase y circuit that s v from hot to neutral in keeping with v versus v strangeness motors intended to run on v three phase are often labelled as v subject what does an electrical service look like there are logically four wires involved with supplying the main panel with power three of them will come from the utility pole and a fourth bare wire comes from elsewhere the bare wire is connected to one or more long metal bars pounded into the ground or to a wire buried in the foundation or sometimes to the water supply pipe has to be metal continuous to where the main water pipe entering the house watch out for galvanic action conductivity breaks often between copper and iron pipe this is the grounding conductor it is there to make sure that the third prong on your outlets is connected to ground this wire normally carries no current one of the other wires will be white or black with white or yellow stripes or sometimes simply black it is the neutral wire it is connected to the centre tap cec center tap in the nec of the distribution transformer supplying the power it is connected to the grounding conductor in only one place often inside the panel the neutral and ground should not be connected anywhere else otherwise weird and or dangerous things may happen furthermore there should only be one grounding system in a home some codes require more than one grounding electrode these will be connected together or connected to the neutral at a common point still one grounding system adding additional grounding electrodes connected to other portions of the house wiring is unsafe and contrary to code if you add a subpanel the ground and neutral are usually brought as separate conductors from the main panel and are not connected together in the subpanel ie still only one neutral ground connection however in some situations certain categories of separate buildings you actually do have to provide a second grounding electrode consult your inspector the other two wires will usually be black and are the hot wires they are attached to the distribution transformer as well the two black wires are degrees out of phase with each other this means if you connect something to both hot wires the voltage will be volts if you connect something to the white and either of the two blacks you will get v some panels seem to only have three wires coming into them this is either because the neutral and ground are connected together at a different point eg the meter or pole and one wire is doing dual duty as both neutral and ground or in some rare occasions the service has only one hot wire v only service subject what is a circuit inside the panel connections are made to the incoming wires these connections are then used to supply power to selected portions of the home there are three different combinations one hot one neutral and ground v circuit two hots no neutral and ground v circuit two hots neutral and ground v circuit neutral and or two v circuits with a common neutral is used for most circuits supplying receptacles and lighting within your house is usually used for supplying power to major appliances such as stoves and dryers they often have need for both v and v or for bringing several circuits from the panel box to a distribution point is usually for special v motor circuits electric heaters or air conditioners note in the us the nec frequently permits a circuit similar to be used for stoves and dryers namely that there are two hot wires and a wire that does dual duty as neutral and ground and is connected to the frame as well as providing the neutral for v purposes three prong plugs instead of four only for stoves dryers connected to the main panel when connected to most sub panels prong plugs and receptacles are required in our not so humble opinion this is crazy but the nfpa claims that this practice was re evaluated for the nec and found to be safe check your local codes or inquire as to local practice there are restrictions on when this is permissible is usually wired with three conductor wire black for hot white for neutral and bare for grounding and have one hot wire coloured red the other black a bare wire for grounding and in a white wire for neutral you will sometimes see wired with just a black white and ground wire since the white is hot in this case both the nec and cec requires that the white wire be permanently marked at the ends to indicate that it is a live wire usually done with paint nail polish or sometimes electrical tape each circuit is attached to the main wires coming into the panel through a circuit breaker or fuse there are in a few locales circuits that look like or except that they have two bare ground wires some places require this for hot tubs and the like one ground is frame ground the other attaches to the motor this may or may not be an alternative to gfci protection subject grounding versus grounded versus neutral according to the terminology in the cec and nec the grounding conductor is for the safety ground i e the green or bare wire the word neutral is reserved for the white when you have a circuit with more than one hot wire since the white wire is connected to neutral and the grounding conductor inside the panel the proper term is grounded conductor however the potential confusion between grounded conductor and grounding conductor can lead to potentially lethal mistakes you should never use the bare wire as a grounded conductor or white wire as the grounding conductor even though they are connected together in the panel but not in subpanels subpanels are fed neutral and ground separately from the main panel usually in the trade and in common usage the word neutral is used for grounded conductor this faq uses neutral simply to avoid potential confusion we recommend that you use neutral too thus the white wire is always except in some light switch applications neutral not ground subject what does a fuse or breaker do what are the differences fuses and circuit breakers are designed to interrupt the power to a circuit when the current flow exceeds safe levels for example if your toaster shorts out a fuse or breaker should trip protecting the wiring in the walls from melting as such fuses and breakers are primarily intended to protect the wiring ul or csa approval supposedly indicates that the equipment itself won t cause a fire fuses contain a narrow strip of metal which is designed to melt safely when the current exceeds the rated value thereby interrupting the power to the circuit fuses trip relatively fast which can sometimes be a problem with motors which have large startup current surges for motor circuits you can use a time delay fuse one brand is fusetron which will avoid tripping on momentary overloads a fusetron looks like a spring loaded fuse a fuse can only trip once then it must be replaced breakers are fairly complicated mechanical devices they usually consist of one spring loaded contact which is latched into position against another contact when the current flow through the device exceeds the rated value a bimetallic strip heats up and bends by bending it trips the latch and the spring pulls the contacts apart circuit breakers behave similarly to fusetrons that is they tend to take longer to trip at moderate overloads than ordinary fuses with high overloads they trip quickly breakers can be reset a finite number of times each time they trip or are thrown when the circuit is in use some arcing takes place which damages the contacts thus breakers should not be used in place of switches unless they are specially listed for the purpose neither fuses nor breakers limit the current per se a dead short on a circuit can cause hundreds or sometimes even thousands of amperes to flow for a short period of time which can often cause severe damage subject breakers can t i use fuses statistics show that fuse panels have a significantly higher risk of causing a fire than breaker panels this is usually due to the fuse being loosely screwed in or the contacts corroding and heating up over time or the wrong size fuse being installed or the proverbial replace the fuse with a penny trick since breakers are more permanently installed and have better connection mechanisms the risk of fire is considerably less fuses are prone to explode under extremely high overload when a fuse explodes the metallic vapor cloud becomes a conducting path result from complete meltdown of the electrical panel melted service wiring through fires in the electrical distribution transformer and having your house burn down breakers don t do this many jurisdictions particularly in canada no longer permit fuse panels in new installations the nec does permit new fuse panels in some rare circumstances requiring the special inserts to key the fuseholder to specific size fuses some devices notably certain large air conditioners require fuse protection in addition to the breaker at the panel the fuse is there to protect the motor windings from overload check the labeling on the unit this is usually only on large permanently installed motors the installation instructions will tell you if you need one subject what size wire should i use for a amp circuit use gauge wire for a amp circuit you can use gauge wire in most locales for a long run though you should use the next larger size wire to avoid voltage drops gauge is only slightly more expensive than gauge though it s stiffer and harder to work with here s a quick table for normal situations go up a size for more than foot runs when the cable is in conduit or ganged with other wires in a place where they can t dissipate heat easily gauge amps we don t list bigger sizes because it starts getting very dependent on the application and precise wire type subject where do these numbers come from there are two considerations voltage drop and heat buildup the smaller the wire is the higher the resistance is when the resistance is higher the wire heats up more and there is more voltage drop in the wiring the former is why you need higher temperature insulation and or bigger wires for use in conduit the latter is why you should use larger wire for long runs neither effect is very significant over very short distances there are some very specific exceptions where use of smaller wire is allowed the obvious one is the line cord on most lamps don t try this unless you re certain that your use fits one of those exceptions you can never go wrong by using larger wire subject what does mean this is used to describe the size and quantity of conductors in a cable the first number specifies the gauge the second the number of current carrying conductors in the wire but remember there s usually an extra ground wire means gauge two insulated current carrying wires plus bare ground wire usually has a black white and bare ground wire sometimes the white is red instead for v circuits without neutral in the latter case the sheath is usually red too wire usually has a black red white and bare ground wire usually carrying v with neutral subject what is a wirenut marrette marr connector how are they used a wire nut is a cone shaped threaded plastic thingummy that s used to connect wires together marrette or marr connector are trade names you ll usually use a lot of them in diy wiring in essence you strip the end of the wires about an inch twist them together then twist the wirenut on though some wirenuts advertise that you don t need to twist the wire do it anyways it s more mechanically and electrically secure there are many different sizes of wire nut you should check that the wire nut you re using is the correct size for the quantity and sizes of wire you re connecting together don t just gimble the wires together with a pair of pliers or your fingers use a pair of blunt nose linesman pliers and carefully twist the wires tightly and neatly sometimes it s a good idea to trim the resulting end to make sure it goes in the wirenut properly some people wrap the open end of the wirenut with electrical tape this is probably not a good idea the inspector may tear it off during an inspection it s usually done because a bit of bare wire is exposed outside the wire nut instead of taping it the connection should be redone subject what is a gfi gfci a gfci is a ground fault circuit interrupter it measures the current current flowing through the hot wire and the neutral wire if they differ by more than a few milliamps the presumption is that current is leaking to ground via some other path this may be because of a short circuit to the chassis of an appliance or to the ground lead or through a person any of these situations is hazardous so the gfci trips breaking the circuit gfcis do not protect against all kinds of electric shocks if for example you simultaneously touched the hot and neutral leads of a circuit and no part of you was grounded a gfci wouldn t help all of the current that passed from the hot lead into you would return via the neutral lead keeping the gfci happy the two pairs of connections on a gfci outlet are not symmetric one is labeled load the other line the incoming power feed must be connected to the line side or the outlet will not be protected the load side can be used to protect all devices downstream from it thus a whole string of outlets can be covered by a single gfci outlet subject where should gfcis be used the nec mandates gfcis for v a or a single phase outlets in bathrooms kitchens within of the sink garages unfinished basements or crawl spaces outdoors near a pool or just about anywhere else where you re likely to encounter water or dampness there are exceptions for inaccessible outlets those dedicated to appliances occupying fixed space typically refrigerators and freezers and for sump pumps and laundry appliances the cec does not mandate as many gfcis in particular there is no requirement to protect kitchen outlets or most garage or basement outlets basement outlets must be protected if you have a dirt floor garage outlets if they re near the door to outside bathrooms and most exterior outlets must have gfcis even if you are not required to have gfci protection you may want to consider installing it anyway unless you need a gfci breaker see below the cost is low in the u s gfci outlets can cost as little as us costs are a bit higher in canada c evaluate your own risk factors does your finished basement ever get wet do you have small children do you use your garage outlets to power outdoor tools does water or melted snow ever puddle inside your garage subject where shouldn t i use a gfci gfcis are generally not used on circuits that a don t pose a safety risk and b are used to power equipment that must run unattended for long periods of time refrigerators freezers and sump pumps are good examples the rationale is that gfcis are sometimes prone to nuisance trips some people claim that the inductive delay in motor windings can cause a momentary current imbalance tripping the gfci note though that most gfci trips are real if you re getting a lot of trips for no apparent reason you d be well advised to check your wiring before deciding that the gfci is broken or useless subject what is the difference between a gfci outlet and a gfci breaker for most situations you can use either a gfci outlet as the first device on the circuit or you can install a breaker with a built in gfci the former is generally preferred since gfci breakers are quite expensive for example an ordinary ge breaker costs us the gfci model costs us there is one major exception if you need to protect a multi wire branch circuit two or more circuits sharing a common neutral wire such as a canadian style kitchen circuit you ll need a multi pole gfci breaker unfortunately these are expensive the cost can range into the hundreds of dollars depending on what brand of panel box you have but if you must protect such a circuit say for a pool heater you have no choice one more caveat gfci outlets are bulky you may want to use an oversize box when installing them on second thought use large actually deep boxes everywhere you ll thank yourself for it incidentally if you re installing a gfci to ensure that one specific outlet is protected such as a bathroom you don t really have to go to all of the trouble to find the first outlet in the circuit you could simply find the first outlet in the bathroom and not gfci anything upstream of it but protecting the whole circuit is preferred when you install a gfci it s a good idea to use the little ground fault protected stickers that come with it and mark the outlets downstream of the gfci you can figure out which outlets are downstream simply by tripping the gfci with the test button and see which outlets are dead subject what s the purpose of the ground prong on an outlet then apart from their use in electronics which we won t comment on and for certain fluorescent lights they won t turn on without a good ground connection they re intended to guard against insulation failures within the device generally the case of the appliance is connected to the ground lead if there s an insulation failure that shorts the hot lead to the case the ground lead conducts the electricity away safely and possibly trips the circuit breaker in the process if the case is not grounded and such a short occurs the case is live and if you touch it while you re grounded you ll get zapped of course if the circuit is gfci protected it will be a very tiny zap which is why you can use gfcis to replace ungrounded outlets both nec and cec there are some appliances that should never be grounded in particular that applies to toasters and anything else with exposed conductors consider if you touch the heating electrode in a toaster and you re not grounded nothing will happen if you re slightly grounded you ll get a small shock the resistance will be too high but if the case were grounded and you were holding it you d be the perfect path to ground subject why is one prong wider than the other polarization nowadays many two prong devices have one prong wider than the other this is so that the device could rely not guaranteed on one specific wire being neutral and the other hot this is particularly advantageous in light fixtures where the the shell should neutral safety or other devices which want to have an approximate ground reference ie some radios most prong extension cords have wide prongs too this requires that you wire your outlets and plugs the right way around you want the wide prong to be neutral and the narrow one hot most outlets have a darker metal for the hot screw and lighter coloured screw for the neutral if not you can usually figure out which is which by which prong the terminating screw connects to subject what kind of outlets do i need in a kitchen the nec requires at least two amp small appliance circuits for kitchens the cec requires split duplex receptacles outlets must be installed such that no point is more than nec mm cec from an outlet every counter wider than nec or mm cec must have at least one outlet the circuit these outlets are on may not feed any outlets except in the kitchen pantry or dining room furthermore these circuits are in addition to any required for refrigerators stoves microwaves lighting etc non dedicated outlets within of a sink must be protected by a gfci nec only split duplex receptacles are fed with a v circuit the tab is broken on the hot side of the outlet and one hot goes to the upper outlet and the other hot goes to the lower outlet the neutral connects to both outlets through one screw when carrying through to another outlet the neutral must be pigtailed such that removing the outlet or having the neutral connection fall off doesn t cause the neutral to disconnect from downstream outlets subject where must outlets and switches be in bathrooms there must be at least one outlet in each bathroom adjacent to the sink in addition to any outlet that may be incorporated in the light fixture all such outlets must be gfci protected subject what is romex nm nmd what is bx when should i use each romex is a brand name for a type of plastic insulated wire sometimes called non metallic sheath the formal name is nm this is suitable for use in dry protected areas ie inside stud walls on the sides of joists etc that are not subject to mechanical damage or excessive heat most newer homes are wired almost exclusively with nm wire there are several different categories of nm cable bx cable technically known as armored cable or ac has a flexible aluminum or steel sheath over the conductors and is fairly resistant to damage teck cable is ac with an additional external thermoplastic sheath protection for cable in concealed locations where nm or ac cable is run through studs joists or similar wooden members the outer surface of the cable must be kept at least mm cec nec from the edges of the wooden members or the cable should be protected from mechanical injury this latter protection can take the form of metal plates such as spare outlet box ends or conduit note inspector permitted practise in canada suggests that armored cable or flexible conduit can be used as the mechanical protection but this is technically illegal additional protection recommendations these are rules in the canadian codes they are reasonable answers to the vague references to exposed to mechanical damage in both the nec and cec nm cable should be protected against mechanical damage where it passes through floors or on the surface of walls in exposed locations under feet from the floor ie use ac instead flexible conduit wooden guards etc where cable is suspended as in connections to furnaces or water heaters the wire should be protected canadian practise is usually to install a junction or outlet box on the wall and use a short length of ac cable or nm cable in flexible conduit to jump to the appliance stapling nm to a piece of lumber is also sometimes used where nm cable is run in close proximity to heating ducts or pipe heat transfer should be minimized by means of a mm air space or suitable insulation material a wad of fiberglass nm cable shall be supported within mm of every box or fitting and at intervals of no more than m holes in joists or studs are considered supports some slack in the cable should be provided adjacent to each box while fishing cable is technically in violation it is permitted where proper support is impractical conductor nm cable should never be stapled on edge knight also insists on only one cable per staple referring to the workmanship clause but this seems more honoured in the breach cable should never be buried in plaster cement or similar finish cable should be protected where it runs behind baseboards cable may not be run on the upper edge of ceiling joists or the lower edges of rafters where the headroom is more than m whenever bx cable is terminated at a box with a clamp small plastic bushings must be inserted in the end of the cable to prevent the clamps forcing the sharp ends of the armor through the insulation bx is sometimes a good idea in a work shop unless covered by solid wall coverings in places where damage is more likely like on the back wall of a garage you may be required to use conduit a ul or csa approved metal pipe you use various types of fittings to join the pipe or provide entrance exit for the wire service entrances frequently use a plastic conduit in damp places eg buried wiring to outdoor lighting you will need special wire eg cec nmw nec uf nmw looks like very heavy duty nmd you will usually need short lengths of conduit where the wire enters exits the ground see underground wiring section thermoplastic sheath wire such as nm nmw etc should not be exposed to direct sunlight unless explicitly approved for that purpose many electrical codes do not permit the routing of wire through furnace ducts including cold air return plenums constructed by metal sheeting enclosing joist spaces the reason for this is that if there s a fire the ducting will spread toxic gasses from burning insulation very rapidly through the building teflon insulated wire is permitted in plenums in many areas canada appears to use similar wire designations to the us except that canadian wire designations usually include the temperature rating in celsius eg ac versus ac in the us nm b is degrees celcius note local codes vary this is one of the items that changes most often eg chicago codes require conduit everywhere there are very different requirements for mobile homes check your local codes especially if you re doing anything that s the slightest out of the ordinary wire selection table incomplete the real tables are enormous uncommon wire types or applications omitted condition type cec nec exposed concealed dry plastic nmd nm armor ac ac teck exposed concealed damp plastic nmd nmc armor acwu teck exposed concealed wet plastic nmwu armor acwu teck exposed to weather plastic nmwu tw etc armor teck direct earth burial plastic nmwu uf service entrance rwu twu armor ra teck acwu nmwu not for service entrance subject should i use plastic or metal boxes the nec permits use of plastic boxes with non metallic cable only the reasoning is simple with armored cable the box itself provides ground conductor continuity u s plastic boxes don t use metal cable clamps the cec is slightly different the cec never permits cable armor as a grounding conductor however you must still provide ground continuity for metallic sheath the cec also requires grounding of any metal cable clamps on plastic boxes the advantage of plastic boxes is comparatively minor even for non metallic sheathed cable you can avoid making one ground connection and they sometimes cost a little less on the other hand plastic boxes are more vulnerable to impacts for exposed or shop wiring metal boxes are probably better subject junction box positioning a junction box is a box used only for connecting wires together junction boxes must be located in such a way that they re accessible later ie not buried under plaster excessive use of junction boxes is often a sign of sloppy installation and inspectors may get nasty subject can i install a replacement light fixture in general one can replace fixtures freely subject to a few caveats first of course one should check the amperage rating of the circuit if your heart is set on installing half a dozen watt floodlights you may need to run a new wire back to the panel box but there are some more subtle constraints as well for example older house wiring doesn t have high temperature insulation the excess heat generated by a ceiling mounted lamp can and will cause the insulation to deteriorate and crack with obvious bad results some newer fixtures are specifically marked for high temperature wire only you may find in fact that your ceiling wiring already has this problem in which case replacing any devices is a real adventure other concerns include providing a suitable ground for some fluorescent fixtures and making sure that the ceiling box and its mounting are strong enough to support the weight of a heavy chandelier or ceiling fan you may need to install a new box specifically listed for this purpose a x across the ceiling joists makes a good support metal brackets are also available that can be fished into ceilings thru the junction box hole and mounted between the joists there are special rules for recessed light fixtures such as pot lamps or heat lamps when these are installed in insulated ceilings they can present a very substantial fire hazard the cec provides for the installation of pot lamps in insulated ceilings provided that the fixture is boxed in a coffin usually x x made by making a pair of joists high and covering with plywood that doesn t have any insulation yes that s feet long nec rules are somewhat less stringent they require at least clearance between the fixture and any sort of thermal insulation the rules also say that one should not obstruct free air movement which means that a cec style coffin might be worthwhile presumably that s up to the local inspector the cec doesn t actually mandate the coffin per se this seems to be an inspector requirement to make absolutely certain that the fixture can t get accidentally buried in insulation ie if you have insulation blown in later there are now fixtures that contain integral thermal cutouts and fairly large cases that can be buried directly in insulation they are usually limited to watt bulbs and are unfortunately somewhat more expensive than the older types before you use them you should ensure that they have explicit ul or csa approval for such uses follow the installation instructions carefully the prescribed location for the sensor can vary there does not yet appear to be a heat lamp fixture that is approved for use in insulation the coffin appears the only legal approach subject what does it mean when the lights brighten when a motor starts this usually means that the neutral wire in the panel is loose depending on the load balance one hot wire may end up being more than v and the other less than v with respect to ground this is a very hazardous situation it can destroy your electronic equipment possibly start fires and in some situations electrocute you ie some us jurisdictions require the stove frame connected to neutral if this happens contact your electrical authority immediately and have them come and check out the problem note a brief second brightening is sometimes normal with lighting and motors on the same v with neutral circuit a loose main panel neutral will usually show increased brightness far longer than one second in case of doubt get help subject what is phase power should i use it can i get it in my house three phase power has three hot wires degrees out of phase with each other these are usually used for large motors because it is more efficient provides a bit more starting torque and because the motors are simpler and hence cheaper you re most likely to encounter a phase circuit that shows volts between any hot and ground and volts between any two hots the latter shows the difference between a normal v v common neutral circuit which is volts between the two hots there are phase circuits with different voltages bringing in a phase feed to your house is usually ridiculously expensive or impossible if the equipment you want to run has a standard motor mount it is much cheaper to buy a new v or v motor for it in some cases it is possible to run phase equipment on ordinary power if you have a capacitor start unit or use a larger motor as a auto generator these are tricky but are a good solution if the motor is non standard size or too expensive or too big to replace the taunton press book the small shop has an article on how to do this if you must note that you lose any possible electrical efficiency by using such a converter the laws of thermodynamics guarantee that subject is it better to run motors at or theoretically it doesn t make any difference however there is a difference is the amount of power lost in the supply wiring all things being equal a v motor will lose times less power in the house wiring than a v motor this also means that the startup surge loss will be less and the motor will get to speed quicker and in some circumstances the smaller power loss will lead to longer motor life this is usually irrelevant unless the supply wires are more than feet long subject what is this nonsense about hp on v a circuits it is a universal physical law that hp is equal to watts given heating loss power factor and other inefficiencies it is usually best to consider hp is going to need watts a v a circuit can only deliver watts to a motor so it cannot possibly be more than approximately hp given rational efficiency factors hp is more like it some equipment manufacturers sears in particular most router manufacturers in general advertise a hp rating that is far in excess of what is possible they are giving you a stall horsepower or similar that means the power is measured when the motor is just about to stop turning because of the load what they don t mention is that if you kept it in that condition for more than a few seconds hopefully your breaker will trip otherwise the motor will melt it s drawing far more current than it can continuously when comparing motors compare the continuous horsepower this should be on the motor nameplate if you can t find that figure check the amperage rating which is always present subject how do i convert two prong receptacles to three prong older homes frequently have two prong receptacles instead of the more modern three these receptacles have no safety ground and the cabling usually has no ground wire neither the nec or cec permits installing new prong receptacles anymore there are several different approaches to solving this if the wiring is done through conduit or bx and the conduit is continuous back to the panel you can connect the third prong of a new receptacle to the receptacle box nec mainly cec frowns on this practise if there is a copper cold water pipe going nearby and it s continuous to the main house ground point you can run a conductor to it from the third prong run a ground conductor back to the main panel easiest install a gfci receptacle the ground lug should not be connected to anything but the gfci protection itself will serve instead the gfci will also protect downstream possibly also two prong outlets if you do this to protect downstream outlets the grounds must not be connected together since it wouldn t be connected to a real ground a wiring fault could energize the cases of prong devices connected to other outlets be sure though that there aren t indirect ground plug connections such as via the sheath on bx cable the cec permits you to replace a two prong receptacle with a three prong if you fill the u ground with a non conducting goop like caulking compound this is not permitted in the nec subject are you sure about gfcis and ungrounded outlets should the test button work we re sure about what the nec and cec say remember though that your local codes may vary as for the test button there s a resistor connecting the load side of the hot wire to the line side of the neutral wire when you press the test button current through this resistor shows up as an imbalance and trips the gfci this is a simple passive and reliable test and doesn t require a real ground to work if your gfci does not trip when you press the test button it is very probably defective or miswired again if the test button doesn t work something s broken and potentially dangerous the problem should be corrected immediately the instructions that come with some gfcis specify that the ground wire must be connected we do not know why they say this the causes may be as mundane as an old instruction sheet or with the formalities of ul or csa listing perhaps the device was never tested without the ground wire being connected on the other hand ul or csa approval should only have been granted if the device behaves properly in all listed applications including ungrounded outlet replacement one of us called leviton their gfcis are labeled for installation on grounded circuits only the technician was surprised to see that he agreed that the nec does not require it and promised to investigate subject how should i wire my shop as with any other kind of wiring you need enough power for all devices that will be on simultaneously the code specifies that you should stay under of the nominal capacity of the circuit for typical home shop use this means one circuit for the major power tools and possibly one for a dust collector or shop vac use at least gauge wire many power tools have big motors with a big start up surge if you can use amp breakers nec though cec requires standard a receptacles which means you d have to replug all your equipment lights should either be on a circuit of their own and not shared with circuits in the rest of the house or be on at least two separate circuits the idea is that you want to avoid a situation where a blade is still spinning at several thousand rpm while you re groping in the dark for the off switch do install lots of outlets it s easier to install them in the beginning when you don t have to cut into an existing cable it s useful if at least two circuits are accessible at each point so you can run a shop vac or a compressor at the same time as the tool you really want but use metal boxes and plates and maybe even metal sheathed cable you may have objects flying around at high speeds if something goes a bit wrong note that some jurisdictions have a no horizontal wiring rule in workshops or other unfinished areas that are used for working what this means is that all wiring must be run along structural members ie stapled to studs other possible shop circuits include heater circuits v circuits for some large tools and air compressor circuits don t overload circuits and don t use extension cords if you can help it unless they re rated for high currents a coiled extension cord is not as safe as a straight length of wire of the same gauge also the insulation won t withstand as much heat and heat dissipation is the critical issue if your shop is located at some remove from your main panel you should probably install a subpanel and derive your shop wiring from it if you have young children you may want to equip this panel with a cut off switch and possibly a lock if you want to install individual switches to safe particular circuits make sure you get ones rated high enough for example ordinary light switches are not safely able to handle the start up surge generated by a table saw buy horsepower rated switches instead finally note that most home shops are in garages or unfinished basements hence the nec requirements for gfcis apply and even if you know that you d never use one of your shop outlets to run a lawn mower the next owner of your house might have a different idea note fine woodworking magazine often carries articles on shop wiring april is one place to start subject underground wiring you will need to prepare a trench to specifications use special wire protect the wire with conduit or special plastic tubing and possibly lumber don t use creosoted lumber it rots thermoplastic insulation and acts as a catalyst in the corrosion of lead the transition from in house to underground wire is generally via conduit all outdoor boxes must be specifically listed for the purpose and contain the appropriate gaskets fittings etc if the location of the box is subject to immersion in water a more serious style of water proof box is needed and of course don t forget the gfcis the required depths and other details vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction so we suggest you consult your inspector about your specific situation a hint buy a roll of bright yellow tape that says buried power line and bury it a few inches above where the wire has been placed subject aluminum wiring during the s aluminum instead of copper wiring became quite popular and was extensively used since that time aluminum wiring has been implicated in a number of house fires and most jurisdictions no longer permit it in new installations we recommend even if you re allowed to that do not use it for new wiring but don t panic if your house has aluminum wiring aluminum wiring when properly installed can be just as safe as copper aluminum wiring is however very unforgiving of improper installation we will cover a bit of the theory behind potential problems and what you can do to make your wiring safe the main problem with aluminum wiring is a phenomenon known as cold creep when aluminum wiring warms up it expands when it cools down it contracts unlike copper when aluminum goes through a number of warm cool cycles it loses a bit of tightness each time to make the problem worse aluminum oxidises or corrodes when in contact with certain types of metal so the resistance of the connection goes up which causes it to heat up and corrode oxidize still more eventually the wire may start getting very hot melt the insulation or fixture it s attached to and possibly even cause a fire since people usually encounter aluminum wiring when they move into a house built during the s we will cover basic points of safe aluminum wiring we suggest that if you re considering purchasing a home with aluminum wiring or have discovered it later that you hire a licensed electrician or inspector to check over the wiring for the following things fixtures eg outlets and switches directly attached to aluminum wiring should be rated for it the device will be stamped with al cu or co alr the latter supersedes the former but both are safe these fixtures are somewhat more expensive than the ordinary ones wires should be properly connected at least way around the screw in a clockwise direction connections should be tight while repeated tightening of the screws can make the problem worse during the inspection it would pay off to snug up each connection note that aluminum wiring is still often used for the main service entrance cable it should be inspected push in terminals are an extreme hazard with aluminum wire any connections using push in terminals should be redone with the proper screw connections immediately there should be no signs of overheating darkened connections melted insulation or baked fixtures any such damage should be repaired connections between aluminum and copper wire need to be handled specially current canadian codes require that the wire nut used must be specially marked for connecting aluminum to copper the nec requires that the wire be connected together using special crimp devices with an anti oxidant grease the tools and materials for the latter are quite expensive not practical to do it yourself unless you can rent the tool any non rated receptacle can be connected to aluminum wiring by means of a short copper pigtail see above shows reasonable workmanship neat wiring properly stripped not nicked wire etc if when considering purchasing a home an inspection of the wiring shows no problems or only one or two we believe that you can consider the wiring safe if there are signs of problems in many places we suggest you look elsewhere if the wrong receptacles are used you can replace them with the proper type or use pigtails having this professionally done can range from to per receptacle switch you can do this yourself too subject i m buying a house what should i do congratulations but it s generally a good idea to hire an inspector to look through the house for hidden gotchas not just for wiring but plumbing and structural as well if an inspection of the wiring shows no problems or only one or two minor ones we believe that you can consider the wiring safe after any minor problems are fixed if there are signs of problems in many places we suggest you look elsewhere here s some hints on what to look for obvious non code wiring can include zip cord wiring either concealed or nailed to walls hot wiring on the identified neutral conductor without proper marking ungrounded grounding outlets except when downstream of a gfci splices hanging in mid air other than proper knob and tube switched neutrals unsecured romex swinging about like grapevines certain wiring practises that are actually to code or were at one time sometimes reveal diy wiring that may have hidden violations switches that seem to control nothing abandoned perhaps not properly terminated wiring a wall switch that shuts off a group of lights that are separately controlled by other wall switches except when it s really convenient switches and outlets in bizarre locations great numbers of junction boxes without outlets or lamps junction boxes with great numbers of wires going into them wiring that passes through a closet instead of a wall or ceiling backwrapped grounding wires subject what is this weird stuff old style wiring in the years since edison invented electricity several different wiring styles have come and gone when you buy an older home you may encounter some of this stuff this section describes the old methods and some of their idiosyncrasies the oldest wiring system you re likely to encounter is called knob and tube k t it is made up of individual conductors with a cloth insulation the wires are run along side structural members eg joists or studs using ceramic stand offs knobs wire is run through structural members using ceramic tubes connections were made by twisting the wire together soldering and wrapping with tape since the hot and neutral were run separately the wiring tends to be rather confusing a neutral often runs down the centre of each room with taps off to each fixture the hot wire tended to run from one fixture to the next in some cases k t isn t colour coded so the neutral is often the same colour as the hot wires you ll see k t in homes built as late as the s comments on k t the people installing k t were pretty paranoid about electricity so the workmanship tends to be pretty good the wire insulation and insulators tend to stand up very well most k t i ve seen for example is in quite good condition no grounding grounding is usually difficult to install boxes are small receptacle replacement particularly with gfci can be difficult no bushing on boxes either so wiring changes need special attention to box entry sometimes the neutral isn t balanced very well between separately hot circuits so it is sometimes possible to overload the neutral without exceeding the fusing on any circuit building code does not permit insulation in walls that contain k t connection to existing k t from new circuits can be tricky consult your inspector modern wiring practise requires considerably more outlets to be installed than k t systems did since k t tends to be in pretty decent condition it generally isn t necessary to replace it simply because it s k t what you should watch out for is renovations that have interfered with it and be cautious about circuit loading in many cases it s perfectly reasonable to leave existing k t alone and add new fixtures on new circuits using modern techniques after k t they invented multi conductor cable the first type you will see is roughly a cloth and varnish insulation it looks much like the romex cable of the last decade or two this stuff was used in the s and s again no grounding conductor it was installed much like modern wiring its major drawback is that this type of insulation embrittles we ve seen whole systems where the insulation would fracture and fall off at a touch bx cable of the same vintage has similar problems this stuff is very fragile and becomes rather hazardous if the wires become bare this wiring should be left untouched as much as possible whenever an opportunity arises replace it a simple receptacle or switch replacement can turn into a several hour long frustrating fight with electrical tape or heat shrink tubing after this wiring technique the more modern romex was invented it s almost a asphalt impregnated cloth often a bit sticky this stuff stands up reasonably well and doesn t present a hazard and is reasonably easy to work with it does not need to be replaced it should be considered as safe as the modern stuff thermoplastic insulation wire just don t abuse it too much subject where do i buy stuff try to find a proper electrical supply outlet near you their prices will often be considerably better than chain hardware stores or diy centres have better quality materials have wider variety including the odd stuff and have people behind the counter that know what you re talking about cultivate friendly knowledgeable sales people they ll give you much valuable information chris

sci.electronics	grounding power wiring was re a question about vac outlet wiring there has been quite a bit of discussion about house wiring and grounding practices here a few points need to be clarified the equipment grounding conductor green green with a yellow stripe bare or the metal sheath or pipe of some wiring methods is used as a safety ground to carry fault currents back to the circuit breaker panel and to limit the voltage on the metal case of utilization equipment or other metal objects it should never except for a few exceptions to be discussed later carry the normal operating current of a connected load some equipment has filters in the power supply which may cause some slight current flow through the grounding conductor much communications or audio equipment is sensitive to noise or slight voltages on the grounding conductor and may require special wiring of the grounding conductors to provide reliable operation orange outlets are often used for this with insulated grounding conductors wired back to the panel box and in many cases back to the service anyone installing such a system should read both the section on grounding in the national electric code and publications on installing quiet isolated ground systems the code requires the insulated grounding conductors green wires to run with the current carrying conductors back to the panel box and if required back all the way to the service entrance where it is bonded to the service ground water pipe or rod many of these systems are installed illegally or unsafely where they do not provide a safe ground or a quiet ground or either the grounded conductor of a circuit often called the neutral which is referred to in the code as the identified conductor and is supposed to be white or natural grey this conductor is supposed to be connected to ground in most electrical systems at a single point generally at the service entrance panel this connection is through the main bonding jumper in many household service panels the main bonding jumper is actually a bonding screw which attaches the neutral busbar to the case of the panel the grounded conductor neutral is generally a current carrying conductor in the case of a volt circuit it is one of the two conductors completing the circuit from the panel to the load device since the grounded conductor neutral is only connected to the grounding conductor bare or green at the service entrance if the load is any distance from the service and draws any significant current there will be a small but measurable voltage between the grounded and grounding conductors at the load under normal operating conditions if you should incorrectly connect the grounded neutral conductor to the grounding conductor at the load some of the neutral current will flow instead through the grounding conductor since there will now be current flowing through the grounding conductor it will also no longer be quite at ground potential at the load end if the load equipment has a metal case which is connected to the grounding conductor through the u ground plug the metal case is now also no longer quite at ground potential the difference under normal non short circuit conditions may be only a few tenths of a volt but it could also be a volt or two this normally does not present a shock hazard however if you let the metal case of the grounded equipment come into contact with an independently grounded object such as a water or gas pipe a radiator a metal air conditioning duct or such part of the neutral current will try to flow through this aalternate ground path if the contact is not solid you will get a significant arc a low voltage but possibly moderate current arc under the wrong conditions this arcing could start a fire it is possible in some cases that the sneak ground current could also flow through a wire of inadequate size causing it to overheat with the incorrect non single point grounding of the neutral if there is a short circuit from hot to neutral the high short circuit current which may flow will cause a much higher voltage on the grounding conductor which increases the possibility for shock or fire also if you incorrectly multiply connect the neutral and ground the voltage on the ground system is seen as noise bu computer or audio equipment often causing malfunction i have spent some hours tracking down such shorts in technical facilities where they were inducing severe hum into equipment the neutral is usually bonded to the ground at the distribution transformer as well as at the service entrance of each dwelling this is done primarily for lightning protection so that induced lightning currents have a short path back to ground and also to assure that the currents drawn by shorts to grounded objects like pipes draw enough current to trip circuit breakers or blow fuses quickly the bad side of this is that not all the neutral current from the dwelling goes through the neutral wire back to the transformer some of it flows through the grounding electrode water pipe etc this may cause corrosion in the pipes and possibly in things like underground fuel oil tanks and it may also cause measurable ac magnetic fields due to the large loop between the hot conductors in the service and the neutral current in the water pipe and ground there are those who feel these fields may be unhealthy don t flame me on this i m just telling you where the field comes from not it s health effect as far as i m concerned the jury is still out on this note that the bonding jumper is only installed at the main panel not at any sub distribution panels this is one reason why it is illegal to run service entrance cable with the sheath used as a neutral to a sub panel you must have a seperate insulated conductor for the neutral the sheath can be used in this application only as the grounding conductor if the neutral is bonded to the grounding conductor in the sub panel say by forgetting to remove the bonding screw all the grounding conductors of the loads on that panel will be above ground with the possible problems listed above the code makes exceptions for ranges and dryers as well as feeds from one building to another in the cases of the range and dryer the neutral may be used as the equipment ground under certain conditions instead of a seperate wire every time the code is revised these exceptions come up for review these exceptions were in fact the first required safety grounds in the days before u ground outlets and such the appliance manufacturers don t want to have to redesign their ranges and driers and the contractors don t want to have to run four wire cable with four fairly heavy expensive wires in place of three wire to the appliances no question it would be safer with seperate neutrals to the stove but the neutral current is low for most burner settings since most current is in the volt hots except at some low settings the wires are large gauge and there are few reported cases of injury or damage so far the exceptions have survived in the case of feeds between buildings it s primarily for lightning protection people doing wiring should be aware what is and what isn t a legal grounding conductor obviously the bare wire in romex with ground is anywhere there is a green wire installed such as in a portable cord that is a good grounding conductor the sheath of bx clamped in bx connectors in metal boxes is a legal grounding conductor in the us bx has an aluminum band run under the steel sheath to lower the resistance of the sheath you can just cut this aluminum band off at the ends you don t have to bond it to anything it does its job by touching every turn of the bx sheath conduit or emt thinwall tubing is generally a legal grounding conductor but may require a bonding locknut where it enters a box or panel particularly for larger pipes greenfield looks like big bx but you pull your own wires in the empty sheath after you run it is not a legal grounding conductor as it doesn t have the aluminum band to bond it and the spiral steel has too much resistance and inductance you have to run a seperate green grounding conductor inside the greenfield wiremold is also not a legal grounding conductor as the paint on the boxes often prevents good contact and the feed to the wiremold extension is often from a box in the wall that may not be well connected to the first wiremold box i have personally discovered cases where the entire run of wiremold and the cases of everything plugged into all the outlets on the run were hot with volts why do i get a shock every time i touch my computer and the radiator here in the office because there was no ground wire in the wiremold and one of the outlets had shorted to the edge of the wiremold box you must run a ground wire back in the wiremold from the outlets at least to the first box in the original wiring conduit bx etc where you can bond the wire to the box with a screw bnding clip or whatever on another issue while you should ground the green wire lug on gcfi outlets when ever there is a place to ground them it is legal in the nec to use them without a ground if no ground is available it is better to have the protection of the ground fault interrupter than no protection if you don t install it the interrupter doesn t depend on the ground to trip it is desirable to connect the ground if available because if the ground is connected the interrupter will trip as soon as a faulty device is plugged in whereas without the ground it will not trip until someone or something provides a ground path for those questioning the legal use of ungrounded gcfi s read in the nec d exception this is the code my code is in the city but i know the rule hasn t

as hot thermodynamically in many fossil fuel plants and of course there is less danger of radioactive contamination actually the reasons you don t see so many cooling towers at fossil plants are fossil units multiple units per plant are generally smaller than nuclear plants mwe seemed to be a very popular size when many fossil plants were built the average nuclear plant is mwe many fossil plants were grandfathered when water discharge regulations were adopted why those old dirt burners can t harm anything let em go powered draft cooling towers low enough to the ground to be generally not visible from off site are quite popular with fossil plants fossil plants used to get much less regulatory attention than nuclears actually fossil fuel plants run hotter than the usual boiling water reactor nuclear plants there s a gripe in the industry that nuclear power uses vintage steam technology so it s more important in nuclear plants to get the cold end of the system as cold as possible hence big cooling towers oil and gas fired steam plants also have condensers but they usually are sized to get the steam back into hot water not most of the way down to ambient some plants do cool the condensers with water rather than air as one canadian official asked about thermal pollution de icing a river said up here we view heat as a resource actually the condensing environment is essentially the same for plants of similar size the issues are the same regardless of where the heat comes from condensers are run at as high a vacuum as possible in order to reduce aerodynamic drag on the turbine the condenser pressure is normally water s vapor pressure at the condensing temperature it is desirable that the steam exhaust be free of water droplets because moisture in the steam causes severe erosion damage to the turbine low pressure blades and because entrained water moving at high velocity causes erosion of the condenser tubes the coldest and thus lowest pressure condensing environment is always the best a related issue is that of pumping the condensate from the hotwell where the water ends up after dripping off the condenser tubes since the condenser is at a very low pressure the only force driving the condensate into the hotwell pumps is gravity if the condensate is too hot or the gravity head is too low the condensate will reflash into steam bubbles and cause the condensate pumps to cavitate this is a particularly destructive form of cavitation that is to be avoided at all costs the hotwell pumps are located in the lowest point in the plant in order to provide a gravity head to the pumps how much lower they must be is a function of how hot the water is allowed to get in the hotwell typically hotwell temperatures run between and degrees depending on the temperature of the river water this term is used to describe the river grade water even when the cooling tower system is operating in closed loop mode and essentially no river water is pumped when the river water temperature is high in the summer operators will typically allow the hotwell level to rise in order to provide more gravity head there is a tradeoff involved since higher hotwell levels will encroach onto the condensing tubes and reduce the condenser area at least in the east and elsewhere where moisture actually exists in the air the river water will almost always be cooler than the discharge water from the cooling towers the temperature of the discharge water from the cooling towers is set by the ambient air temperature and humidity it is very rare in the east to hear of actual river water temperatures exceeding degrees a vast difference from the typical days degrees humidity we see routinely in the east it is not unusual particularly where the econazis have been successful in clamping rigid discharge water temperature limits on a plant for the plant to have to reduce the firing rate when the air temperature gets too high and the condenser cannot handle the heat load without excessive pressure everybody runs closed cycle boilers the water used is purified of solids which otherwise crud up the boiler plumbing when the water boils purifying water for boiler use is a bigger job than cooling it so the boiler water is recycled true actually secondary plant the part that makes electricity and feeds feedwater to the boiler water chemistry has been the bastard stepchild until recently and has not gotten the respect it deserves the plant chemists have just in the past decade or so fully understood the costs of impure water by impure i mean water with a few dozen extra micromho of conductivity and or a few ppm of dissolved oxygen secondary water is now typically the most pure one will find outside the laboratory john john de armond wd oqc

sci.electronics	re radio electronics free information card in article c ulqg i acsu buffalo edu v mb k ubvmsb cc buffalo edu neil b gandler writes how does the radio electronics free information cards work do they just send you some general information about the companies that advertise in their magazine or does it also give you sign you up for a catalog that depends entirely upon the advertiser whose number you circled radio electronics compiles all of the cards then each advertiser gets a computer printout of the names and addresses of all of the readers who circled their number some magazines also provide the data on self adhesive labels and the really big magazines provide the data on computer disk the advertiser decides what to do with the data they get you will notice that the radio electronics information card commonly called a bingo card in the industry includes lines for a company name and a business phone number my guess would be that the big national advertisers make a distinction between hobbiests and professionals as best they can for example if you include motorola as your company and include a business phone and a mail stop tektronics will probably send you a copy of their hard bound catalog and have a sales engineer call you about a week later if you leave it blank odds are they will send you a slick brochure and direct you to a local retail outlet medium and small companies are more likely to send you th e whole catalog and then some companies like digikey or jameco have nothing to mail out accept the catalog a couple of other interesting points about bingo cards free industry magazines like edn and such also log your card to their computer they use the information at least three ways they note that you really do read the magazine and are more likely to continue your subscription or push you through repeated mailings to re subscribe they also compile how many people requested which data for their marketing demographics this way thay can tell a prospective advertiser that of readers requesting data were interested in capacitors and finally some magazines rent lists of readers who request certain information for example tektronics can rent a list of everyone who requested information about test equipment other than tektronic s in the past months the other point in the data the advertiser receives many magazines include how many items you circled on the card if they want the advertiser can attempt to cull out the literature collectors from the serious potential customers can you say qualified sales leads i thought you could what s the best way for a hobbiest to deal with bingo cards never circle more than number on the card if you want more than items use the second card and mail it a couple of weeks later if you are really really serious and you really really want the information call the advertiser and ask this will also cut about days off the the response time virtually everyone takes a voice on the phone more seriously than data on a computer printout to help insure you keep getting a trade magazine that you re not really qualified for send in a bingo card at least every other month and circle two or three numbers include a business name and phone number even if it s your house advertisers almost never call john schuch publisher of the arizona high tech times the arizona electrical journal the arizona hvac news all of which have bingo cards

sci.med	re sinus vs migraine was re sinus endoscopy i noticed several years ago that when i took analgesics fairly regularly motrin at the time i seemed to get a lot of migraines but had forgotten about that until i started reading some of the posts here i generally don t take nsaids or tylenol for headaches because i ve found them to be ineffective however i have two other pain sources that force me to take nsaids currently naprosyn first is some pelvic pain that i get at the beginning of my period and then much worse at midcycle i have had surgery for endometriosis in the past years ago so the drs tell me that my pain is probably due to the endometriosis coming back i ve tried synarel it reduced the pain while i took it mos but the pain returned immediately after i stopped three doctors have suggested hysterectomy as the only real solution to my problem although i don t expect to have any more children i don t like the idea of having my uterus and one remaining ovary removed the first ovary was removed when i had the surgery for endometriosis one of the drs that suggested i get a hysterectomy is an expert in laser surgery but perhaps thinks that type of procedure is only worthwhile on women who still plan to have children so basically all i m left with is toughing out the pain this would be impossible without naprosyn or something similar but not aspirin that doesn t work and motrin gave me horrible gastritis a few years ago so i m through with it in fact naprosyn works very well at eliminating the pain if i take it regularly as i did when i had severe back pain and pain in both legs as i ll discuss in a moment generally though i wait until i have the pain before i take the naprosyn but then it takes several hours for it reduce the pain it s actually quite effective at reducing the pain it just takes quite a while in the meantime i m frequently in severe pain the other pain source i have is chronic lower back pain resulting in bilateral radiculopathy i ve had mris xrays ct scan and emgs i ve had of them and don t intend to ever do that again with nerve conduction tests the tests have not been conclusive as to what is causing my back and leg pain the mri reports both say i have several bulging degeneratig disks and from the xrays and mri i think it is apparent that i have arthritis the reading on the ct scan was that there are two herniations l l and l l but others hav looked at the films and concluded that there are no herniations the second emg and nerve conduction studies shows significant denervation compared to the first emg oh yeah i had some other horrible test called something like somatic evoked response which showed that the internal nerves are working fine anyway the bottom line is that i sometimes have severe pain in both legs and back pain the back pain is there all the time but i can live with it when the leg pain is there i need some analgesic anti inflammatory medication to reduce the pain to a level where i can work so i took naprosyn regulary for months every time i tried to stop the leg pain got worse so i d always resume since last november i have taken it much less frequently and primarily for the pelvic pain i have been going to physical therapy for the last months times a week after the first month or so my therapist put me on pelvic traction she had tried it earlier but it had caused a lot of pain in my back this time she tried it at a lower weight after a month or two the pain in my legs began going away but the traction aways caused discomfort in my lower back which could be reduced with ultrasound and massage so now i don t have nearly as much pain in my legs in fact my therapist took me off traction about weeks ago getting back to my original reason for this post even if i can avoid taking analgesic for headaches i really can t avoid them entirely because i have other pain sources that force me to use them oh i forgot to mention that it has been suggested to me that i have back surgery but i m avoiding that too i find the migraines difficult to deal with occassionally i have to take off work but usually i can work but at a reduced capacity i m a systems engineer and do a lot of reading and writing when the pelvic pain is bad i can t concentrate much i usually end up jumping out of my chair every few minutes because the pain is so bothersome when the pain in my back is bad it can cause severe burning in both legs shooting pains in my legs electric shock type of pain in my feet and toes and basically when it gets bad i can t really sit at all then i end up spending most of my time home and in bed so even if the analgesics contribute to the migraines the migraines are more tolerable than the other pain sources i get a lot of migraines an average of to a month which last days i ve taken cafergot the first time the caffiene really got to me so i reduced the dosage but i don t like the side effects if i take more than two i get diahrea if i get a very bad headache i will eventually take the cafergot my neurologist wasn t very helpful when i told him my problems with cafergot he said that when sumatriptan becomes available i should try that i ve tried several other medications fiornal midrin fiornal with codeine tegretol and inderal but they either didn t work or i couldn t tolerate them so what can i do my doctor s seem to be satisfied with me just trying to tolerate the pain which i agree with most of the time but not when i have a lot of pain i ve had some bad experiences with surgery my heart stopped once from the anesthesia i was told that it was likely the succinylcholine and i ve already had surgery several times anyway the point of what i m saying is that even if analgesics can contribute to migraines some people need to take them to

sci.med	natural anti cancer aids remedies the biggest reason why the cost of medical care is so extremely high and increasing is that natural methods of treatment and even diagnosis are still being systematically ignored and suppressed by the money grubbing and power mongering medical establishment some examples of very low cost natural anti cancer remedies are listed in the following article natural anti cancer remedies a rd opinion some of these remedies also work against aids disclaimer this list was compiled from unorthodox sources that have shown themselves to be reliable the compiler of this list is not a doctor of any kind but is exercising his first amendment constitutional right of free speech on the subjects of his choice most of these remedies can be found in any grocery store most of the rest of them can be found in any health food store what is important is how they are used and what else is excluded during their use the day fast st day eat as much fresh fruit as you want one kind at a time preferably grapes nd day eat all the vegetables you want at least half raw including garlic also whole kernel corn to help scrape clean the intestinal linings rd day drink all the fresh fruit and vegetable juice you want preferably start with to ounces of prune juice with pulp followed by a gallon of pure not from concentrate apple juice then grape juice stay close to your home bathroom th day eat all the un salted nuts no peanuts and dried fruit you want preferably raisins and almonds almonds contain laetrile th day one gallon of lemonade squeeze the juice from two lemons into a gallon of water preferably distilled and add to tablespoons of locally made honey no sugar drink one glass per hour everyone including healthy people should do this one day every week preceded by a large glass of prune juice with pulp th day same as th day th day same as th day all days eat only the foods listed above for each day along with your usual vitamin and mineral supplements plus as much distilled water as you want the grape diet eat to ounces of fresh grapes every hours am to pm every day for six days eat nothing else during the six days but drink as much distilled water as you want apple cider vinegar mix a teaspoon of pure apple cider vinegar not apple cider flavored vinegar regular vinegar is harmful in a glass of water preferably distilled and drink all of it do this or times per day for weeks then stop for a week repeat if desired do this along with a normal healthy diet of natural foods this remedy is especially effective against those types of cancer that resemble a fungus as well as against other kinds of fungus infections the sea salt soda bath please keep an open mind fill a bathtub with moderately warm water so the level comes up almost to the overflow drain when you get in immerse yourself in it for a minute and then completely dissolve in the bath water pound of sun evaporated sea salt regular salt won t work and pound of fresh baking soda soak in this bath for to minutes while exercising your fingers toes and limbs turning sideways and onto your stomach dunking your head sitting up and laying back down chomping your teeth together etc among other things the sea salt soda bath neutralizes the accumulated effects of x rays etc as described in the book born to be magnetic vol by frances nixon precautions only the one person using each bath should prepare it and drain it for at least minutes after taking the bath stay away from and even out of sight of other people your greatly expanded aura energy field during that time could disrupt other people s fields two hours after the bath eat at least ounces of yogurt containing active yogurt cultures the bath may kill friendly bacteria also better yet take a billion bacteria acidophilus capsule which is also an excellent daily remedy against the effects of a i d s because it kills all kinds of harmful bacteria in the digestive tract taking a big load off the remaining immune system because this external bath can kill in ternal bacteria it may also be a cure for lyme disease do not take this bath within a few hundred miles of a thunder storm within days of a full moon nor during major or minor periods as listed in the solunar tables published bimonthly in field stream magazine because of the measurable disruptive ambient environmental energy fields present at those times do not take this bath more than four times per year miscellaneous natural anti cancer remedies for skin cancer apply stabilized aloe vera jel to the affected skin twice daily and take to tablespoons per day of stabilized aloe vera juice internally for about months d m s o dimethyl sulfoxide causes cancer cells to perform normal cell functions almonds un blanched un roasted contain laetrile to help prevent cancer eat several almonds every day to help cure cancer eat several ounces of almonds per day never take large concentrated doses of laetrile orally it will kill you take it intravenously only cancer cells contain a certain enzyme which converts laetrile into cyanide which then kills the cell this enzyme is also present in the digestive system anti oxidants are free radical scavengers and include vitamin e selenium mcg per day is safe for most people chromium up to mcg per day vitamin a iu per day is safe for most people superoxide dismutase up to units per day vitamin c up to mg per day and bht butylated hydroxy toluene to capsules of bht every night at bedtime will also make one immune against herpes both types suppress herpes symptoms if one already has herpes prevent spreading herpes to other people but will not cure herpes bht might also do these things against a i d s which is really a form of cancer similar to leukemia see the book life extension by durk pearson and sandy shaw hydrogen peroxide dilute twelve drops of hydrogen peroxide in a glass of pure water preferably distilled and drink it do this once or twice per day hours before or after eating or drinking anything else apply hydrogen peroxide directly to skin cancers several times per day use hydrogen peroxide only if you are taking a good daily dose of some of the various anti oxidants described above vitamin mineral supplements are more effective and much less expensive when combined together in mega doses into single tablets made from natural sources cancer cells can not live in a strong maxwell north magnetic field especially if it is pulsating on and off a strong south magnetic field is an aphrodisiac in my opinion all types of ionizing radiation treatments for cancer should be replaced with daily minute doses of pulsating maxwell north magnetic fields properly made and operated radionics psionics machines can both diagnose and cure all forms of cancer as well as most other medical problems some radionics psionics machines can even take cross sectional x ray like photos of cancer tumors etc with out x rays interferon tablets taheebo tea lapacho homeopathy can cure cancer and many other medical problems even drug addiction mg per day of chelated zinc can help prevent or cure prostate trouble this list is not exhaustive the above natural remedies can cure both diagnosed and un diagnosed cancers as well as prevent them and also prevent and cure many other medical problems including heart diseases they are not too simple and inexpensive to work effectively besides acting on a person biologically and chemically these remedies especially the day fast and the grape diet send a strong message to one s subconscious mind programming it to cure the cancer in my opinion if a person finds out that s he has cancer then s he should promptly try at least the first remedies described above in sequence starting with the day fast before resorting to the un natural and expensive mutilations and agonies poison burn and mutilate of orthodox cancer treatment organi ed crime disclaimer this list was compiled from unorthodox

free demo outside us comments i have a copy of this and it works as advertised i would say it is better for rsi prevention than rsi management because it does not allow breaks at periods less than minutes also it interrupts you based on clock time rather than typing time which is not so helpful unless you use the keyboard all day worked ok on windows though it did occasionally crash with a uae not sure why also refused to work with the space bar on one pc and has one window without window controls very usable though and does not require any sound hardware tool lifeguard commercial software

i have had a play with this and it works ok its user interface design is much better in though still a bit unusual expensive tool around and it does the job it is also the only tool with a redistributable demo so if you do get the demo post it on your local bulletin boards ftp servers and bitnet servers does not include general info on rsi and ergonomics but it does have the ability to step backward in the exercise sequence which is good for repeating the most helpful exercises tool typewatch freeware version october available from email to richardd hoskyns co uk anonymous ftp soda

typing based on how long you have been continuously typing it does not provide exercises but it does check that you really do take a break and tells you when you can start typing again typewatch now tells you how many minutes you have been typing today each time it warns you which is useful so you know how much you really type it also logs information to a file that you can analyse or simply print out the warning message appears on your screen in character mode in a pop up window for x windows or as a zephyr message for those with athena stuff tim freeman tsf cs cmu edu has put in a lot

you have problems or want to give feedback tool various calendar batch queue programs available from various sources platforms various description any calendar reminder program that warns you of an upcoming appointment can be turned into an ad hoc rsi management tool or any batch queue submission program that lets you submit a program to run at a specific time to display a message to the screen using windows as an example create a calendar file and include this filename in your win ini s load line so you get it on every startup of windows suppose you want to have breaks every minutes starting from am press f special time to enter an appointment enter hit enter and type some text in saying what the break is for then press f to set an alarm on this entry and repeat for the next appointment by using windows recorder you can record the keystrokes that set up breaks throughout a day in a rec file put this file on your run line as above and you will then with a single keypress be able to set up your daily appointments with rsi exercises the above method should be adaptable to most calendar programs an example using batch jobs would be to submit a simple job that runs at am and warns you to take a break this will depend a lot on your operating system while these approaches are not ideal they are a good way of forcing yourself to take a break if you can t get hold of a suitable rsi management tool if you are techie enough you might want to write a version of typewatch see above for your operating system using batch jobs or whatever fits best tool digital watches with count down timers available from various sources e g casio bp description many digital watches have timers that count down from a settable number of minutes they usually reset easily to that number either manually or automatically while these are a very basic tool they are very useful if you are writing reading driving or doing anything away from a computer which can still cause or aggravate rsi the great advantage is that they remind you to break from whatever you are doing comments my own experience was that cutting down a lot on my typing led to my writing a lot more and still reading as much as ever which actually aggravated the rsi in my right arm though the left arm improved getting a count down timer watch has been very useful on some occasions where i write a lot in a day i have tried an old fashioned hour glass type egg timer but these are not much good because they do not give an audible warning of the end of the time period keyboard remapping tools these enable you to change your keyboard mapping so you can type one handedly or with a different two handed layout one handed typing tools may help but be very careful about how you use them if you keep the same overall typing workload you are simply doubling your hand use for the hand that you use for typing and may therefore make matters worse tool hsh public domain available from anonymous ftp soda berkeley edu pub typing injury hsh shar platforms unix don t know which ones description allows one handed typing and other general keyboard remappings only works through tty s so you can use it

sci.med	re science and methodology was homeopathy tradition in article lsj gninnl c saltillo cs utexas edu turpin cs utexas edu russell turpin writes i wrote or to use a phrasing that i think is more accurate science is the investigation of phenomena that avoids methods and reasoning that are known to be erroneous from past foul ups in article c iu hbn bunyip cc uq oz au bd psych psy uq oz au writes i can agree with this if you are talking about the less fundamental aspects of scientific method in fact i don t see the alternative as i don t think that the fundamentals are capable of experimental investigation in saying this i am agreeing with the work of people like kuhn feyerabend and lakatos while methodology cannot be subject to the same kind of experimental investigation as that to which it is applied it can be critically appraised methodologies can be compared to each other sometimes by the conflicting results they produce this kind of critical appraisal and comparison together with the inappropriateness of existing methodologies for new fields of study is what drives the evolution of methodologies and how we think about them as usual you are missing the whole point russell because you are not willing to even consider questionning your basic article of faith which is that science is merely a matter of methodology and that the highest purpose of science is to avoid making mistakes this is like saying that the most important aspect of business management is accurate bookkeeping if science were no more than methodology and not making mistakes it would be a poor thing indeed what was the methodology of darwin what was the methodology of einstein what was for that matter the methodology of jenner and pasteur in an earlier article russell turpin writes none of the foregoing should be read as meaning that we should open the door to practitioners of quackery and psuedo science modern advocates of homeopathy chiropracty and traditional chinese medicine receive little respect because for the most part they use methods and reasoning that the kind of research lee lady recommends has shown to be terribly faulty this does not imply that all their treatments are ineffective it does imply that those who rely on faulty methodology and reasoning are incapable of discovering which treatments are effective and which are not first of all i think you are arguing against a straw man because i don t think that anyone here is arguing that quackery pseudo science homeopathy chiropracty and traditional chinese medicine should be accepted as science i in particular think the basic ideas of homeopathy and chiropracty seem extremely flaky what some of us do believe however is that some of these things including some of the flaky ideas are deserving of serious scientific attention if in fact it were true as you have stated above that those who do not use the currently fashionable methodology can have no idea what is effective and what is not then science today would not exist for all of current science is based on the past work of scientists whose methodology by current standards was seriously flawed it is certainly true that as methodology improves we need to re examine those results derived in the past using less perfect methodologies it is also true that the results obtained by people today who still rely on those early methodologies needs to be re examined in a more rigorous fashion by those qualified to do so credibly but to say that nobody who fails to do elaborate double blind studies is capable of knowing their ass from a hole in the ground and to say that no ideas that come from outside the scientific establishment could possibly be worthy of serious investigation this truly marks one s attitude as doctrinaire cultist this attitude is not compatible with a belief in reason in the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists psychology seems less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects lady uhunix uhcc hawaii edu lady uhunix bitnet

experience pain at all then you absolutely need to go see a doctor as soon as you possibly can the difference of a day or two can mean the difference between a short recovery and a long drawn out ordeal go see a doctor now your garden variety doctor may not necessarily be familiar with this sort of injury generally any hospital with an occupational therapy clinic will offer specialists in these kinds of problems don t wait though go see a doctor the remainder of this information is paraphrased without permission from a wonderful report by new zealand s department of labour occupational safety and health service occupational overuse syndrome treatment and rehabilitation a practitioner s guide first a glossary or fancy names for how you shouldn t have your hands note you re likely to hear these terms from doctors and keyboard vendors rsi repetitive strain injury a general term for many kinds of injuries oos occupational overuse syndrome synonym for rsi ctd cumulative trauma disorder another synonym for rsi wruld work related upper limb disorders yet another synonym for rsi cts carpal tunnel syndrome see below hyperextension marked bending at a joint pronation turning the palm down wrist extension bending the wrist up supination turning the palm up wrist flexion bending the wrist down pinch grip the grip used for a pencil ulnar deviation bending the wrist towards the little finger power grip the grip used for a hammer radial deviation bending the wrist toward the thumb abduction moving away from the body overspanning opening the fingers out wide now then problems come in two main types local conditions and diffuse conditions local problems are what you d expect specific muscles tendons tendon sheaths nerves etc being inflamed or otherwise hurt diffuse conditions often mistaken for local problems can involve muscle discomfort pain burning and or tingling with identifiable areas of tenderness in muscles although they re not necessarily the problem why does occupational overuse syndrome occur here s the theory normally your muscles and tendons get blood through capillaries which pass among the muscle fibers when you tense a muscle you restrict the blood flow by the time you re exerting of your full power you re completely restricting your blood flow without fresh blood your muscles use stored energy until they run out then they switch to anaerobic without oxygen metabolism which generates nasty by products like lactic acid which cause pain once one muscle hurts all its neighbors tense up perhaps to relieve the load this makes sense for your normal sort of injury but it only makes things worse with repetitive motion more tension means less blood flow and the cycle continues another by product of the lack of blood flow is tingling and numbness from your nerves they need blood too anyway when you re typing too much you re never really giving a change for the blood to get back where it belongs because your muscles never relax enough to let the blood through stress poor posture and poor ergonomics only make things worse specific injuries you may have heard of note most injuries come in two flavors acute and chronic acute injuries are severely painful and noticable chronic conditions have less pronounced symptoms but are every bit as real tenosynovitis an inflamation of the tendon sheath chronic tenosynovitis occurs when the repetitive activity is mild or intermittent not enough to cause acute inflamation but enough to exceed the tendon sheath s ability to lubricate the tendon as a result the tendon sheath thickens gets inflamed and you ve got your problem tendonitis an inflammation of a tendon repeated tensing of a tendon can cause inflamation eventually the fibers of the tendon start separating and can even break leaving behind debris which induces more friction more swelling and more pain sub acute tendonitis is more common which entails a dull ache over the wrist and forearm some tenderness and it gets worse with repetitive activity carpal tunnel syndrome the nerves that run through your wrist into your fingers get trapped by the inflamed muscles around them symptoms include feeling pins and needles tingling numbness and even loss of sensation cts is often confused for a diffuse condition adverse mechanical tension also known as neural tension this is where the nerves running down to your arm have become contracted and possibly compressed as a result of muscle spasms in the shoulders and elsewhere amt can often misdiagnosed as or associated with one of the other oos disorders it is largely reversible and can be treated with physiotherapy brachial plexus stretches and trigger point therapy others for just about every part of your body there s a fancy name for a way to injure it by now you should be getting an idea of how oos conditions occur and why just be careful many inexperienced doctors misdiagnose problems as carpal tunnel syndrome when in reality you may have a completely different problem always get a second opinion before somebody does something drastic to you like surgery typing posture ergonomics prevention treatment the most important element of both prevention and recovery is to reduce tension in the muscles and tendons this requires learning how to relax if you re under a load of stress this is doubly important tune out the world and breath deep and regular relaxing should become a guiding principle in your work every three minutes take a three second break every three minutes take a three second break really do it every three minutes it s also helpful to work in comfortable surroundings calm down and relax if you can t sleep you really need to focus on this rest sleep and relaxation are really a big deal there are all kinds of other treatments of course drugs can reduce inflamation and pain custom molded splints can forcefully prevent bad posture surgery can fix some problems exercise can help strengthen your muscles regular stretching can help prevent injury good posture and a good ergonomic workspace promote reduced tension ice or hot cold contrast baths also reduce swelling only your doctor can say what s best for you posture here are some basic guidelines i so liked the way this was written in the new zealand book that i m lifting it almost verbatim from appendix dwallach let your shoulders relax let your elbows swing free keep your wrists straight pull your chin in to look down don t flop your head forward keep the hollow in the base of your spine try leaning back in the chair don t slouch or slump forward alter your posture from time to time every minutes get up and bend your spine backward set the seat height first your feet should be flat on the floor there should be no undue pressure on the underside of your thighs near the knees and your thighs should not slope too much now draw yourself up to your desk and see that its height is comfortable to work at if you are short this may be impossible the beest remedy is to raise the seat height and prevent your legs from dangling by using a footrest now adjust the backrest height so that your buttocks fit into the space between the backrest and the seat pan the backrest should support you in the hollow of your back so adjust its tilt to give firm support in this area if you operate a keyboard you will be able to spend more time leaning back so experiment with a chair with a taller backrest if available now i diverge a little from the text a good chair makes a big difference if you don t like your chair go find a better one you really want adjustments for height back angle back height and maybe even seat tilt most arm rests seem to get in the way although some more expensive chairs have height adjustable arm rests which you can also rotate out of the way you should find a good store and play with all these chairs pick one that s right for you in the san francisco bay area i highly recommend just chairs the name says it all keyboard drawers wrist pads and keyboard replacements there is a fair amount of controvery on how to get this right for some people wrist pads seem to work wonders however with good posture you shouldn t be resting your wrists on anything you would prefer your keyboard to be right there if you drop your arms at your side and then lift your hands up at the elbow you want your keyboard under your hands when your elbows are at about degrees of course you want to avoid pronation wrist extension and ulnar deviation at all costs wrist pads may or may not help at this you should get somebody else to come and look at how you work how you sit how you type and how you relax it s often easier for somebody else to notice your hunched shoulders or deviated hands some argue that the normal flat keyboard is antiquated and poorly designed a number of replacements are available on the market today check out the accompanying typing injury faq keyboards for much detail requests for more info

sci.med	water supplies vulnerable to milwaukee type disease outbreak here is a press release from the natural resources defense council new data show about major u s water supplies vulnerable to milwaukee type disease outbreak to national desk environment writer contact erik olson or sarah silver both of the natural resources defense council washington april internal epa data released today by the natural resources defense council reveals that about large water systems serving cities from boston to san francisco do not filter to remove disease carrying organisms leaving those communities potentially vulnerable to a disease outbreak similar to the one affecting milwaukee the epa list is attached these internal epa documents reveal that the safety of water supplies in many american cities is threatened by inadequate pollution controls or filtration said erik olson a senior attorney with nrdc water contamination isn t just a problem in bangladesh it s also a problem in bozeman and boston as of june about large surface water systems on epa s list probably will be breaking the law the safe drinking water act requires all surface water systems to either filter their water or fully protect the rivers or lakes they use from pollution olson continued some systems are moving towards eventually implementing filtration systems but are expected to miss the law s deadline olson pointed out that the threat of contamination is already a reality in other cities a survey of u s surface water systems by water utility scientists found that percent of raw water samples contained the milwaukee organism cryptosporidium and percent contained a similar parasite called giardia adding to the level of concern a general accounting office study released today by house health and environment subcommittee chairman henry waxman indicates serious deficiencies in the nation s system for conducting and following through on sanitary surveys of water systems this new information raises a huge warning sign that millions of americans can no longer simply turn on their taps and be assured that their water is safe to drink we must immediately put into place programs to protect water sources from contamination and where this is not assured filtration equipment must be installed to protect the public olson noted the time has come for many of the nation s water utilities to stop dragging their feet and to aggressively protect their water from contamination consumers are prepared to pay the modest costs needed to assure their water is safe to drink nrdc is a national non

sci.med	re science and methodology was homeopathy tradition avoiding mistakes is certainly highly desirable however it is also widely acknowledged that perfectionism is inimicable to creativity and in ordinary life perfectionism carried beyond a certain point is indicative of a psychological disorder in the extreme case a perfectionist becomes so paralyzed by all the possible mistakes he might make that he is unable to even leave the house in science we want to discover as much truth about the world as possible and we also want to have as much certainty as possible about these discoveries usually there is some trade off between these two desiderata the search for scope and the search for certainty if th century mathematicians had demanded total rigor from newton and leibniz then there would probably be no calculus today because neither of the two could explain calculus in a way that really made sense since they lacked the concept of a limit and in fact because of the lack of a rigorous foundation they made a number of errors in their use of calculus it was only a hundred years later that weistrass was able to give a solid grounding for the ideas of newton and leibniz nonetheless what newton and leibniz did was undoubtedly science and mathematics gained a great deal more from the application of their important ideas than it lost through the mistakes they made in article apr kestrel edu king reasoning com dick king writes somebody writes i doubt if einstein used any formal methodology he also proposed numerous experiments which if performed would distinguish a universe in which special relativity holds from one in which it does not einstein played by the rules which demand that hypotheses only be put out there if there exists a specific experiment that could disprove them these are not the rules according to many who post to sci med and sci psychology according to these posters if it s not supported by carefully designed controlled studies then it s not science taken to the extreme i believe that the attitude that empirical studies are everything and ideas are nothing results in a complete stultification of science for one thing an insistence on an elaborate and expensive methodology results in a sort of scientific trade unionism where those outside the establishment and lacking institutional or corporate support have no chance to obtain a hearing i don t in the least believe that this is the intention of the arbiters of scientific methodology nonetheless it is one of the results and although institutional science has certainly produced many wonderful results i think it is a foolish arrogance for scientists to believe that no one outside the establishment and using less than perfect empirical methodology will ever come with anything worthwhile furthermore the big bucks approach to science promotes what i think is one of the most significant errors in science choosing to investigate questions because they can be readily handled by the currently fashionable methodology or because one can readily get institutional or corporate sponsorship for them instead of directing attention to those questions which seem to have fundamental significance for instance certain questions cannot be easily investigated with statistical methods because the relevant factors are not quantitative one could argue that this is the case for almost all questions in many areas of psychology in my opinion a perusal of many of the papers resulting from the attempt by psychologists to force these questions into a statistical framework gives the lie to russell turpin s assertion that current scientific methods avoid all known errors i think that asking the wrong question is probably the most fundamental error in science ignoring potentially valuable ideas is one of the others and i think that scientific journals are full of all too many studies done with impeccable empirical methods but which are worthless because the wrong question was asked in the first place in the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists psychology seems less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects lady uhunix uhcc hawaii edu lady uhunix bitnet

related to organ transplantation and donation mike transplant recipients international organization long island chapter p o box huntington ny newsletter april volume iv no next meeting the next meeting is wednesday april at pm at the knights of columbus emerald manor uniondale avenue in uniondale our guest speaker will be dr lewis teperman dr teperman trained in pittsburgh under dr starzl and is now the assistant director of the liver transplant program at new york university medical center dr teperman will discuss current trends in transplantation and treatment and will answer questions he is a long time friend of trio surgeon to many of our members and always a gracious and delightful guest it is sure to be a very informative interesting and engaging evening our hospitality committee bette and vito suglia and jim spence will be well prepared and at last the weather should be cooperative we hope to see a very large gathering to welcome dr teperman wednesday april k of c uniondale last meeting it has been noted here before that the long island chapter of trio has extraordinary power in predicting bad weather being able to forecast rain sleet and snow fully a month in advance no tv weatherman can match us this time we not only scored again but we were also able to disable the long island railroad making travel really difficult none the less many braved the snow and we had an interesting meeting and good conversation our scheduled speaker mrs elizabeth linnehan a professional nutritionist had a family emergency and was not able to attend she hope she will be with us in the fall to discuss diet and medications however ms jennifer friedman an image consultant and sister of a liver transplant recipient was kind enough to step in on very short notice ms friedman gave us a lot of good advice about choosing clothes and makeup even a bit for men to help us look well and healthy and to minimize some of the cosmetic effects of some of the medicine and drugs we take we are most grateful to jennifer and thank her for an entertaining evening annual meeting in addition to welcoming dr teperman the april meeting is also the annual meeting of the chapter this is the official notice of the meeting as required by our by laws the main purpose of the meeting is to review the past year solicit member views and ideas for better ways to meet their needs and to elect members of the board of directors for the coming two year term the nominating committee has prepared the following slate for the board anne liver recipient and don treffeisen robert heart recipient and eulene smith vito kidney recipient and bette suglia kay grenzig liver recipient jan schichtel kidney recipient larry juliano kidney recipient david bekofsky director public education litp those remaining on the board for another year are robert carroll liver kidney pancreas recipient jerry kidney recipient and jeanne eichhorn ron kidney donor and marie healy peter smith bone marrow recipient patricia ann yankus kidney and pancreas recipient walter ruzak kidney recipient this may seem to be a big board but many hands make light work and with our various medical uncertainties it is good to have backups for all the jobs on the board therefore in addition to the slate being presented for voting nominations will also be accepted from the floor there is no set number of board members and there is plenty of work in addition brief treasurer s and membership reports will be given and the floor will be open for any new business suggestions or comments anyone would like to bring up we will keep the formal meeting short so that we can spend the majority of the time with dr teperman future meetings remember the scheduled guests for the rest of the year may

sci.med	re science and methodology was homeopathy tradition in article lsu q innia saltillo cs utexas edu turpin cs utexas edu russell turpin writes i agree with everything that lee lady wrote in her previous post in this thread gee maybe i ve misjudged you russell anyone who agrees with something i say can t be all bad seriously i m not sure whether i misjudged you or not in one respect i still have a major problem though with your insistence that science is mainly about avoiding mistakes and i still disagree with your contention that nobody who doesn t use methods deemed scientific can possibly know what s true and what s not deleted material which i agree with back to lee lady these are not the rules according to many who post to sci med and sci psychology according to these posters if it s not supported by carefully designed controlled studies then it s not science these posters are making the mistake that i have previously criticized of adhering to a methodological recipe a carefully rules such as support the hypothesis by a carefully designed and controlled study are too narrow to apply to all investigation i think that the requirements for particular reasoning to be convincing depends greatly on the kinds of mistakes that have occurred in past reasoning about the same kinds of things to reuse the previous example we know that conclusions from uncontrolled observations of the treatment of chronic medical problems are notoriously problematic okay so let s see if we agree on this first of all there are degrees of certainty it might be appropriate for instance to demand carefully controlled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth to the extent that there is any such thing the effectiveness of a certain treatment on the other hand highly favorable clinical experience even if uncontrolled can be adequate to justify a preliminary judgement that a treatment is useful this is often the best evidence we can hope for from investigators who do not have institutional or corporate support in this case it makes sense to tentatively treat claims as credible but to reserve final judgement until establishment scientists who are qualified and have the necessary resources can do more careful testing secondly it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards of evidence for a pronounced effect than for one that is marginal i come to this dispute about what science is not only as a mathematician but as a veteran of many arguments in sci psychology and occasionally in sci med about nlp neurolinguistic programming much of the work done to date by nlpers can be better categorized as informal exploration than as careful scientific research for years now i have been trying to get scientific and clinical psychologists to just take a look at it to read a few of the books and watch some of the videotapes courtesy of your local university library not for the purpose of making a definitive judgement but simply to look at the nlp methodology especially the approach to eliciting information from subjects and look for ideas and hypotheses which might be of scientific interest and most especially to be aware of the questions nlp suggests which might be worthy of scientific investigation over and over again the response i get in sci pychology is if this hasn t been thoroughly validated by the accepted form of empirical research then it can t be of any interest to us to me the ultimate reducio ad absurdum of the extreme there ve got to be controlled studies position is an nlp technique called the fast phobia trauma cure simple phobias as opposed to agoraphobia may not be the world s most important psychological disorder but the nice thing about them is that it doesn t take a sophisticated instrument to diagnose them or tell when someone is cured of one the nlp phobia cure is a simple visualization which requires less than minutes nlpers claim that it can also be used to neutralize a traumatic memory and hence is useful in treating post traumatic stress syndrome it is essentially a variation on the classic desensitization process used by behavioral therapists a subject only needs to be taken through the technique once or in the case of ptsd once for each traumatic incident the process doesn t need to be repeated and the subject doesn t need to practice it over again at home now to me it seems pretty easy to test the effectiveness of this cure especially if as nlpers claim the success rate is extremely high take someone with a fear of heights as i used to have take them up to a balcony on the th floor and observe their response spend minutes to have them do the simple visualization send them back up to the balcony and see if things have changed check back with them in a few weeks to see if the cure seems to be lasting more long term follow up is certainly desirable but from a scientific point of view even a cure that lasts several weeks has significance in any case there are many known cases where the cure has lasted years to the best of my knowledge there is no known case where the cure has been reversed after holding for a few weeks my own cure incidentally was done with a slightly different nlp technique before i learned of the fast phobia trauma cure ten years later now i enjoy living on the th floor of my building and having a large balcony the folks over in sci psychology have a hundred and one excuses not to make this simple test they claim that only an elaborate outcome study will be satisfactory a study of the sort that nlp practitioners many of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice can ill afford to do most of them are also just plain not interested because the whole idea seems frivolous and since they re not part of the scientific establishment they have no tangible rewards to gain from scientific acceptance the fast phobia trauma cure is over ten years old now and the clinical psychology establishment is still saying we don t have any way of knowing that it s effective these academics themselves have the resources to do a study as elaborate as anyone could want of course but they say why should i prove your theory and the burden of proof is on the one making the claim one academic in sci psychology said that it would be completely unscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasn t been described in a scientific journal it s described in a number of books and i ve posted articles in sci psychology describing it in as much detail as i m capable of actually at least one fairly careful academic study has been done with favorable results but it s apparently not acceptable because it s a doctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journal to me this sort of attitude does not advance science but hinders it this is the kind of thing i have in mind when i talk about doctrinnaire attitudes about science now maybe i have been unfair in imputing such attitudes

sci.med	re barbecued foods and health risk this reminds me of the last graham kerr cooking show i saw today he smoked meat on the stovetop in a big pot he used a strange technique i d never seen before he took a big pot with lid and placed a tray in it made from aluminum foil the tray was about the size and shape of a typical coffee table ash tray made by crumpling a sheet of foil around the edges in the tray he placed a couple spoonfuls of brown sugar a similar quantity of brown rice he said any rice will do the contents of two teabags of earl grey tea and a few cloves on top of this was placed an ordinary aluminum basket type steamer with two chicken breasts in it the lid was put on and the whole assembly went on the stovetop at high heat for or minutes later he removed what looked like smoked chicken breasts what surprises and concerns me are no wood chips where does the smoke flavor come from about or years ago i remember hearing that carmel color obtained by caramelizing sugar a common coloring and flavoring agent had been found to be carcinogenic i believe they injected it under the skin of rats or something if the results were conclusive caramel color would not be legal in the u s yet it is still being used was the initial research result found to be incorrect or what about or years ago i remember earl grey tea being implicated as carcinogenic because it contains oil of bergamot an extract from the skin of a type of citrus fruit does anyone know whatever happened with that story if it were carcinogenic earl grey tea could not have it as an additive yet it apparently continues to do so wrt natural wood smoke i ve smoking a duck right now as it happens i ve noticed that a heavily smoked food item will have an unpleasant tangy taste when eaten directly out of the smoker if the smoke has only recently stopped flowing i find the best taste to be had by using dry wood chips getting lots of smoke right up at the beginning of the cooking process then slowly barbequing for hours and hours without adding additional wood chips my theory is that the unpleasant tangy molecules are low molecular weight stuff like terpenes and that the smoky flavor molecules are some sort of larger molecule more similar to tar the long barbeque time after the initial intensive smoke drives off the low molecular weight stuff just leaving the flavor behind does anyone know if my theory is correct i also remember hearing that the combustion products of fat dripping on the charcoal and burning are carcinogenic for that reason and because it covers the product with soot and some unpleasant tanginess i only grill non drippy meats like prawns directly over hot coals i do stuff like this duck by indirect heat i have a long rectangular weber and i put the coals at one end and the meat at the other end the fat drops directly on the floor below the meat and next time i use the barbeque i make the fire in that end to burn off the fat and help ignite the coals and yet another reason i ve heard not to smoke or barbeque meat is that smoked cured meat like pork sausage and bacon contains nitrosamines which are carcinogenic i m pretty sure this claim actually has some standing don t know about the others an amusing incident i recall was the duncan hines scandal when it was discovered that the people who make duncan hines cake mix were putting a lot of ethylene dibromide edb into the cake mix to suppress weevils this is a fumigant which is known to be carcinogenic the guy who represented the company in the press conference defended himself by saying that the risk from eating duncan hines products every day for a year would be equal to the cancer risk from eating two charcoal broiled steaks what a great analogy when i first heard that my immediate reaction was we should make that a standard unit one charcoal broiled steak would be equivalent to duncans

this device because it seemed to be exactly what i was wishing someone would invent a machine that would massage not vibrate my neck and sub occipital muscles like my physical therapist has done in the past that i could use by myself no doctor visit or inconvenient p t appts for a week later would be needed to use it i could get up in the middle of the night and use it if necessary i have been using it for about a week or so now and love it the base unit is about a x rectangle about high with handles on each side and it plugs into an average outlet the two metal thumbs are about in diameter and protrude about above the base the thumbs are covered with a gray cloth that is non removable they are located more toward one end rather than centered see figure below they move in either clockwise or counter clockwise directions depending on which side of the switch is pushed and are very quiet it can be used from either side for instance the thumbs can be positioned at the base of the neck or the top of the neck depending on which direction you approach it for the neck head the user varies the amount of pressure used by if laying down allowing all or part of the full weight of the head and or neck to rest on the thumbs the handles can also be used if sitting or standing applying pressure with the arms wrists since my wrists are also impaired i m typing this over an extended period of time and i don t have someone living with me who can apply it laying down works well for me for my back i sit in a high backed kitchen chair position the massager behind me at whatever point i want massaged and lean back lightly or not so lightly against it the pressure of leaning back holds it in place if i want to massage the entire spine i simply move it down a few inches whenever i feel like it for my back this machine is far superior to use than the commonly used home made massager of tennis balls taped together with the balls position against a wall or door them over the spine and move the body up and down against them the tennis balls are better than nothing but difficult to use for very long especially if your quads are not in good shape and my long hair gets painfully in the way if i don t pin it up first as far as i m concerned the easier something like this is to use the more likely i ll use do it if there are multiple considerations hassles i m more likely to not bother with it not only has this machine helped with my headaches but my range of motion for my neck and back are greatly increased the first time i used it on my neck sub occipital muscles however i overdid it and pressed too hard against it which resulted in a very tender almost bruised area for a few days i laid off it for about days and applied ice which helped after that i was more gradual about applying pressure at this point the pain in the sub occipital area is now minimal while being massaged i also learned to use very light pressure on my lower back which is the most vulnerable point for me it also eased some painful knots of tension between my shoulder blades although again it took a few days of massaging just a few minutes at a time to really work it out i highly recommend this product if you have similar problems although i cannot vouch for its durability it seems pretty sturdy since i ve had it such a short time i plan to use it not only to ease tension but also to loosen the muscls before exercising and maybe after too i have been ill recently and not able to exercise much for a few weeks so this was very timely for me this is the st product i ve ordered from this company and only recently became aware of it thru a co worker the catalog states they have been in business since it contains quite a few health care products and while they appear to be more expensive than the average health care catalog products they also appear to be of much higher quality with more thought put into what they actually do definitely a step above some other ones i ve seen such as dr leonards health care catalog or mature wisdom i m only but have ended up on some geriatric type mailing lists no big surprise here i consider many of those products to be rip offs particularly targeted toward the elderly with dubious health benefits i apologize for the length of this but it s the kind of info i would like to know before ordering something thru the mail robin

sci.med	re science and methodology was homeopathy tradition i think that part of the problem is that i have proposed a definition of science that i intended to be interpreted broadly and that lee lady has interpreted fairly narrowly my definition is this science is the investigation of the empirical that avoids mistakes in reasoning and methodology discovered from previous work lee lady writes i don t think that science should be defined in a way that some of the activities that lead to really important science namely thinking and informal exploration are not recognized as scientific work unless one classifies thinking and informal exploration as a mistake they fall under my definition i hope no one would consider speculation thinking and informal exploration as unscientific in article c nasf mh news hawaii edu lady uhunix uhcc hawaii edu lee lady writes seriously i m not sure whether i misjudged you or not in one respect i still have a major problem though with your insistence that science is mainly about avoiding mistakes here is where i think we are talking at cross purposes it is not clear to me that the kind of definition i have proposed should be taken as describing what science is mainly about consider for example a definition of invertebrates as all animals lacking a backbone this fairly tells what is an invertebrate and what is not an invertebrate but it hardly tells you what invertebrates are all about one can read this definition and still not know that of all animal species are invertebrates that invertebrates possess a remarkably broad range of form that some invertebrate groups such as insects and nematodes are ubiquitous in all ecosystems etc in short knowing the definition of invertebrates does not tell one what they are mainly about the misunderstanding here is my fault i did not give sufficient context for people to understand my proposed definition okay so let s see if we agree on this first of all there are degrees of certainty it might be appropriate for instance to demand carefully controlled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth to the extent that there is any such thing the effectiveness of a certain treatment on the other hand highly favorable clinical experience even if uncontrolled can be adequate to justify a preliminary judgement that a treatment is useful secondly it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards of evidence for a pronounced effect than for one that is marginal i agree on both counts as an example of the second it would only take a few cases of curing rabies to convince most veterinarians that a treatment was effective despite a lack of controls as to the first i do not think it is useful to talk about absolute scientific truth i think it is more useful to talk about the kinds of evidence that various claims have and the kinds of evidence in particular fields that in the past have proven faulty or reliable the latter is obviously a matter of degree and in each field practitioners try to discover the relevance of different kinds of evidence one of the primary mistakes that marks the advocacy of an idea as psuedo science is that the advocacy lacks any sense of proportion regarding the kinds of evidence related to the proposed claim the kinds of evidence that are actually relevant to it and the historical reasons in the field that certain kinds of evidence are given more weight than others it is perfectly alright to speculate i have read quite a few refereed papers that speculated left and right but the authors were careful to identify the notions as speculative to list what little evidence was presently available for them and to describe how research could proceed to either put the notion on more firm footing or to uncover its problems often what distinguishes whether a paper of this sort passes muster is the thoughtfulness with which the author sets the context and paves the way for future work it is in this area that many proponents of speculative ideas fail the folks over in sci psychology have a hundred and one excuses not to make this simple test they claim that only an elaborate outcome study will be satisfactory a study of the sort that nlp practitioners many of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice can ill afford to do most of them are also just plain not interested because the whole idea seems frivolous and since they re not part of the scientific establishment they have no tangible rewards to gain from scientific acceptance i think a lot of scientists steer away from things that deserving or not garner a patina of kookiness when proponents of some practice see no value in more careful investigation of that practice that sets alarms ringing in many researchers minds this is unfortunate because there is undoubtedly some intersection between things that are worth investigating and things that are advocated by those who seem careless or unreasonable in their advocacy on the other hand i can understand why many scientists would just as soon select other directions for research as gordon banks has pointed out no one wants to become this generation s rhine one academic in

careful academic study has been done with favorable results but it s apparently not acceptable because it s a doctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journal i wonder why the results

info provided about msg making people ill that s the point after all why don t you just look it up in the merk or check out the medical dictionary cite which a doctor mentioned earlier in this thread that s because these peer reviewed studies are not addressing the effects of msg in people they re looking at animal models you can t walk away from this and start ranting about gloom and doom as if there were any documented deleterious health effects demonstrated in humans note that i wouldn t have any argument with a statement like noting that animal administration has pro duced the following blah blah we must be careful about its use in humans this is precisely not what you said among others see olney s excitotoxic food aditives relevance of animal studies to human safety neurobehav toxicol teratol vol i m sure peta would love to hear your arguments tests have been done on rhesus monkeys as well i have never seen a study where the mode of administration was intra ventricular the glu and asp were administered orally some studies used iv and sc intra ventricular is not a normal admin method for food tox studies for obvious reasons you must not have read the peer reviewed works that i referred to or you would never have come up with this brain injection bunk it most certainly is for neurotoxicology you know studies of glutamate involve more than food science whose talking about food science what is this comment supposed to mean neurotoxicology and tratology brain research nature progress in brain research all fine food science journals pardon me but where are you getting this from have you read the journals have you done a thorough literature search so point us to the studies in humans please i m familiar with the literature and i ve never seen any which relate at all to olney s work in animals and the effects of glutamate on neurons then you would know that olney himself has casually referred to chinese restaurant syndrome in a few articles why don t you point us to some studies maybe then this exchange could be productive the point is exceeding the window of course they re amino acids note that people with pku cannot tolerate any phenylalanine well actually they have to tolerate some phenylalanine it s a essential amino acid they just try to get as little as is healthy without producing dangerous levels of phenylalanine and its metabolites in the blood they re unable to metabolise it olney s research compared infant human diets specifically the amount of freely available glu in mother s milk versus commercial baby foods vs typical lunch items from the standard american diet such as packaged soup mixes he found that one could exceed the projected safety margin for infant humans by at least four fold in a single meal of processed foods mother s milk was well below the effective dose goodness i m not saying that it s good to feed infants a lot of glutamate supplemented foods it s just that this projected safety margin is a construct derived from animal models and given that you can prove anything you like we re talking prudent policy in infant nutrition here yet you re misrepresenting it as received wisdom who said anything about received wisdom there is no question that orally administered doses of msg are capable of destroying nearly all neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and the median eminence these areas are responsible for the production of hormones critical to normal neuroendocrine function and the normal development of the vertabrate organism humans are vertebrates now what pray tell do you think will happen when the area of the brain necessary for the normal rhythm of gonadotropin release is missing are you trying to say that humans have no need of their pituitary anh and me of that part of the brain that is responsible for controlling the realease albeit indirectly of estradiol and testosterone how do you expect anyone to do the studies on this it s unethical to sacrifice humans to check out what effects chronic acute etc doses of these compounds are having on the brain tissue in humans the food industry knows this that s why the animal model is used in medicine and psych if you re talking about straight sensitivity it would be useful to define the term there are plenty of studies on psychoneuroimmunology showing the link between attitude and physiology i suspect we may be arguing about separate things only adult sensitivities you and late occuring sequelae of childhood ingestion and its implication for adults me certainly the doses for excitotoxicity in adults are considerably larger than for the young but the additivity of glu and asp and their copious and increased presence in modern processed foods jointly and their hidden presence in hvp necessitates extreme caution why would anyone want to eat compounds which have been shown to markedly perturb the endocrine system in adults the main point is blood levels attained and oral doses would likely have to be greater than sc between who over what i would be most interested in seeing you provide peer reviewed non food industry funded citations to articles disputing that msg has no effects whatsoever you mean asserting you re being intellectually dishonest or just plain confused because you re conflating reports which do not necessarily have anything to do with each other olney s reports would argue a potential for problems in human infants but that s not to say that this says anything whatsoever about the use of msg in most foods nor does he provide any studies in humans which indicate any deleterious effects for obvious reasons it says nothing about msg s contribtion to the phenomenon of the chinese restaurant syndrome it says nothing about the frequent inability to replicate anecdotal reports of msg sensitivity in the lab olney s work provides a putative causal mechanism for some sensitivities terry epelbaum and martin have shown that orally administered msg causes changes in normal gonadotropic hormone fluctutations in adults glu also was found to induce immediate and persistant supression of rhythmic gh secretion and to induce rapid and transient release of prolactin in adults chronically exposed to msg gh is responsible not only for control of growth during development but also converts glycogen into glucose could this be the cause of headaches i don t know dyer

sci.med	re morbus meniere is there a real remedy it would be nice to think that individuals can somehow beat the system and like a space explorer boldly go where no man has gone before and return with a prize cure unfortunately too often the prize is limited and the efficacy of the cure questionable when applied to all sufferers this applies to both medical researchers and non medical individuals just because it appears in an obscure journal and may be of some use does not make the next cure all what about the dozens of individuals who have courageously participated in clinical trials did they have any guarentee of cures are they any less because they didn t trumpet their story all over the world as a parting note wasn t there some studies done on gingko seeds for meniere s to the original poster what about trying for a trial of that it s probably not a final answer but it certainly may alleviate some of the discomfort and you d be helping answer the question for future sufferers gervais
sci.med	re hernia in article c qopx mq encore com sheffner encore com steve heffner writes a bit more than a year ago a hernia in my right groin was discovered it had produced a dull pain in that area the hernia was repaired using the least intrusive orthoscopic method and a plug and patch i suspect you mean laparoscopic instead of orthoscopic now the pain occurs more often my gp couldn t identify any specific problem the surgen who performed the original procedure now says that yes there is a new hernia in the same area and he said that he has to cut into the area for the repair this time my question to the net is there a nonintrusive method to determine if in fact there is a hernia or if the pain is from something else by far the still best method to diagnose a hernia is old fashioned physical examination if you have an obvious hernia sac coming down into your scrotum or a bulge in your groin that is brought about by increasing intra abdominal pressure sometimes is not that obvious the hernia is small and you can only detect it by putting your finger into the inguinal canal whether you have a recurrent hernia or this is related to the previous operation i can t tell you the person that examined you is in the best position to make that determination are there non invasive ways of diagnosing a hernia every now and then folks write about ct scans and ultrasounds for this but these are far too expensive and unlikely to be better than a trained examining finger howard doyle doyle pitt edu

sci.med	mind machines i recently learned about these devices that supposedly induce specific brain wave frequencies in their users simply by wearing them mind machines consist of led gogles head phones and a microprocessor that controls them they strobe the closed eye and send sound pulses in sync with the flashing leds i understand that these devices are experimental but they are available i ve heard claims that they can induce sleep and light trance states for relaxation essentially they are supposed to work without aid of drugs etc i would think that if they work as reported they would be incredibly useful the few sources i ve seen are biased they are selling the things and a friend who has tried them claims that every home should have one so do these mind machines aka light and sound machines work can they induce alpha theta and or delta waves in a person wearing them what research if any has been done on them could they be used in lieu of a tranquilizer or are they just another bit of quackery web homer homer tripos com

sci.med	relief of pain caused by cancer i am not sure if this is the proper group to post this to but here goes anyway about five years ago my mother was diagnosed with having cancer in the lymph nodes under one of her arms after the doctors removed the cancerous area she had full movement of her arm with only slight aching under her arm when she moved it over the course of the next two years the aching got more severe and her complaining to the doctors produced the explanation that it was scar tissue causing the pain at this time her doctor suggested that some physiotherapy should be employed to break up the scar tissue while attending one of her therapy sessions while her arm was being manipulated some damage occured nerve which caused the level of pain to permanently increase severly controlled by tylenol s and some loss of use of the arm palsied wrist and almost no outward lateral movement with great persistence on her part the doctors looked further into the issue and discovered that not all of the cancer had been removed and another tumor had grown under the arm this was removed also but the pain in the arm has not decreased the doctors are not sure exactly why the pain is persisting but feel some sort of nerve damage has occured and they have employed tylenol and soon morphine to relieve the pain she has tried acupuncture by this only provides minor reductions in pain and is only short term my questions are has anyone has heard of similar cases and what if anything was done to reduce the levels of pain are their methods to block nerves so that the pain can be reduced are their methods to restore nerves so that loss of arm function can be restored any general suggestions on pain reduction would be greatly appreciated please respond by email because i do not always get chance to read this group if anyone knows of some literature that may be useful to this case or another newsgroup that i should be posting this to it would also be appreciated gregory w luft internet vgwlu calgary chevron com chevron petroleum techonology company tel fifth ave s w fax calgary alberta canada t p l

that such a disease exists there s a lot of evidence it just hasn t been adequately gathered and published in a way that will convince the die hard melancholic skeptics who quiver everytime the word anecdote or empirical is used snort ah there go my sinuses again for example dr ivker who wrote the book sinus survival always gives oh wow a classic textbook hey they laughed at einstein too before any other treatment a systemic anti fungal such as nizoral to his new patients if they ve been on braod spectrum anti biotics or more times in the last two years he s kept a record of the results and for over patients found that over of his patients get significant relief of allergic sinus symptoms of course this is only the beginning for his program yeah i ll bet tomorrow the world listen uncontrolled studies like this are worthless in my case as i reported a few weeks ago i was developing the classic symptoms outlined in the yeast connection i agree it is a poorly written book e g extreme sensitivity to plastics vapors etc which i never had before started in november within one week of full dosage of sporanox the sensitivity to chemicals has fully disappeared i can now sit on my couch at home without dying after two minutes i m also greatly improved in other areas as well i m sure you are you sound like the typical hysteric hypochondriac who responds to miracle cures of course i have allergy symptoms etc i am especially allergic to molds yeasts etc it doesn t take a rocket scientist to figure out that if one has excessive colonization of yeast in the body and you have a natural allergy to yeasts that a threshold would be reached where you would have perceptible symptoms yeah it makes sense to me so of course it should be taken seriously snort also yeast do produce toxins of various sorts and again you don t have to be a rocket scientist to realize that such toxins can cause problems in some people yeah it sounds reasonable to me of course the question is whether a person who is immune compromised as tests showed i was from over years of antibiotics nutritionally deficiencies because of the stress of infections and allergies etc oh really what tests immune compromised my ass more like credulous malingerer this is a psychiatric syndrome can develop excessive yeast colonization somewhere in the body it is a tough question to answer since testing for excessive yeast colonization is not easy one almost has to take an empirical approach to diagnosis fortunately sporanox is relatively safe unlike past anti fungals still have to be careful however so there s no reason any longer to withhold sporanox treatment for empirical reasons you know it s a shame that a drug like itraconazole is being misused in this way it s ridiculously expensive and potentially toxic the trouble is that it isn t toxic enough so it gets abused by quacks btw some would say to try nystatin unfortunately most yeast grows hyphae too deep into tissue for nystatin to have any permanent affect you ll find a lot of people who are on nystatin all the time the only good thing about nystatin is that it s relatively cheap and when taken orally non toxic but oral nystatin is without any systemic effect so unless it were given iv it would be without any effect on your sinuses i wish these quacks would first use iv nystatin or amphotericin b on people like you that would solve the yeast problem once and for all in summary i appreciate all of the attempts by those who desire to keep medicine on the right road but methinks that some who hold too firmly to the party line are academics who haven t been in the trenches long enough actually treating patients if anybody doctors included said to me to my face that there is no evidence of the yeast connection i cannot guarantee their safety for their incompetence ripping off their lips is justified as far as i am concerned perhaps a little haldol would go a long way towards ameliorating your symptoms are you paying for this treatment out of your own pocket i d hate to think my insurance premiums are going towards this steve dyer dyer you re rude medicine is not a totallly scientific endevour it s often practiced in a disorganized manner most early treatment of non life threatening illness is done on a guess hazarded after anecdotal evidence given by the patient it s an educated guess by a trained person but it s still no more than a guess it s cheaper and simpler to medicate first and only deal further with those people who don t respond there are diseases that haven t been described yet and the root cause of many diseases now described aren t known read a book on gastroenterology sometime if you want to see a lot of them after scientific methods have run out then it s the patient s freedom of choice to try any experimental method they choose and it s well recognized by many doctors that medicine doesn t have all the answers this person said that they had relief by taking the medicine maybe it s a miracle cure maybe it s valid how do you know you might argue with the reasoning the conclusions but your disparaging attack is unwarranted why don t you present an convincing argument for you r beliefs instead of wasting our time in an ad hominem attack jackie

sci.med	getting aids from acupuncture needles someone wrote in expressing concern about getting aids from acupuncture needles unless your friend is sharing fluids with their acupuncturist who themselves has aids it is unlikely not impossible they will get aids from acupuncture needles generally even if accidently inoculated the normal immune response should be enough to effectively handle the minimal contaminant involved with acupuncture needle insertion most acupuncturists use disposable needles use once and throw away they do this because you are not the only one concerned about transmission of diseases via this route so it s good business to advertise disposable needlesused here these needles tend to be of a lower quality however being poorly manufactured and too sharp in my opinion they tend to snag bloodvessels on insertion compared to higher quality needles if i choose to use acupuncture for a given complaint that patient will get their own set of new needles which are sterilized between treatments the risk here for hepatitis hiv etc transmission is that i could mistakenly use an infected persons needles accidently on the wrong patient but clear labelling and paying attention all but eliminates this risk better quality needles tend to slide past vessels and nerves avoiding unpleasant painful snags and hematomas so i use them acupuncture needles come in many lengths and thicknesses but they are all solid when compared to their injection style cousins in china herbal solutionsand western pharmaceuticals are occasionally injected into meridian points purported to have tcm physiologic effects and so require the same hollow needles used for injecting fluid medicine this means thinkingtiny that a samll amount of tissue the diameter of the needle bore will be injected into the body as it would be in a typical shot when the skin is puntured on the other hand when the solid acupuncture needle is inserted the skin tends to squeeze the needle from the tip to the level of insertion such that any cooties that haven t been schmeared away with alcohol before insertion tend to remain on the surface of the skin minimizing invasion from the exterior of course in tcm the body s exterior is protected by the wei protective qi so infection is unlikely or in other words there is a normal inflammatory and immune response that accompanies tissue damage incurred at the puncture site while i m fairly certain your friend will not have a transferable disease transmitted to them via acupuncture needle insertion i would like to know for what complaint they have consulted the acupuncturist not to know if it would be harmful but to know if it would be helpful john badanes dc ca romdas uclink berkeley edu

ne spencer msph std aids program re hoffman md state epidemiologist colorado dept of health jm douglas md denver dept of health and hospitals surveillance and information systems br div of sexually transmitted diseases and hiv prevention national center for prevention svcs cdc editorial note the increase in reported gonorrhea cases in colorado in may represent an overall increase in the occurrence of this disease or more complete reporting stimulated by visitations to laboratories by cdh surveillance staff during the increases in confirmed gonorrhea cases at dmhc and in culture positivity rates in three of four laboratories suggest a real increase in gonorrhea rather than a reporting artifact however the stable culture positivity rate in the nonprofit family planning laboratory which serves a network of clinics statewide indicates that the gonorrhea increase did not uniformly affect all segments of the population one possible explanation for the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in colorado may be gang and drug related sexual behavior as implicated in a recent outbreak of drug resistant gonorrhea and other stds in colorado springs although the high morbidity census tracts in the denver metropolitan area coincide with areas of gang and drug activity this hypothesis requires further assessment to examine the possible role of drug use implicated previously as a factor contributing to the national increase in syphilis the cdh std aids program is collecting information from all persons in whom gonorrhea is diagnosed regarding drug use exchange of sex for money or drugs and gang affiliation the gonorrhea rate for blacks in colorado substantially exceeds the national health objective for the year per objective a race is likely a risk marker rather than a risk factor for gonorrhea and other stds risk markers may be useful for identifying groups at greatest risk for stds and for targeting prevention efforts moreover race specific variation in std rates may reflect differences in factors such as socioeconomic status access to medical care and high risk behaviors in response to the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in colorado

effectiveness in disease and injury prevention impact of adult safety belt use on restraint use among children less than years of age selected states and source mmwr date apr motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death among children and young adults in the united states and account for more than million years of potential life lost before age annually child safety seats and safety belts can substantially reduce this loss from through all states passed legislation requiring the use of child safety seats or safety belts for children although these laws reduce injuries to young children by an estimated motor vehicle crash related injuries remain a major cause of disability and death among u s children while the use of occupant restraints among children decreases inversely with age usage for those aged years aged years and aged years in addition parents who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to use restraints for their children to characterize the association between adult safety belt use and adult reported consistent use of occupant restraints for the youngest child aged less than years within a household cdc analyzed data obtained from the behavioral risk factor surveillance system brfss during and this report summarizes the findings from this study data were available for respondents aged greater than or equal to years in states that participated in brfss a population based random digit dialed telephone survey and administered a standard injury control and child safety module developed by cdc of these respondents had a child aged less than years in their household each respondent was asked to specify the child s age and the frequency of restraint use for that child the two categories of child restraint and adult safety belt use in this analysis were consistent use i e always buckle up and less than consistent use i e almost always sometimes rarely or never buckle up data were weighted to provide estimates representative of each state software for survey data analysis sudaan was used to calculate point estimates and confidence intervals statistically significant differences were defined by p values of less than each of the states had some type of child restraint law of these six arizona kentucky maine nebraska rhode island and west virginia had no law requiring adults to use safety belts four idaho maryland pennsylvania and washington had a secondary enforcement mandatory safety belt law i e a vehicle had to be stopped for a traffic violation before a citation for nonuse of safety belts could be issued and one state new york had a primary enforcement mandatory safety belt law i e vehicles could be stopped for a safety belt law violation alone in nine states child passenger protection hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april laws included all children aged less than years but the other two states used both age and size of the child as criteria for mandatory restraint use the analysis in this report subgrouped states into those having a law requiring adult safety belt use law states and those without such a law no law states overall of children aged less than years reportedly were not consistently restrained during automobile travel both child restraint use and adult restraint use were significantly higher p less than chi square test in law states than in no law states versus and versus respectively high rates of restraint use for children aged less than or equal to year were reported by both adults indicating consistent and less than consistent safety belt use figure adults with consistent use reported high rates of child occupant restraint use regardless of the child s age range for year olds to for year olds in comparison for adults reporting less than consistent safety belt use the rate of child occupant restraint use declined sharply by the age of the child range for year olds to for year olds when comparing children of consistent adult safety belt users with children of less than consistent adult safety belt users confidence intervals overlap for the two youngest age groups i e aged less than and year reported child occupant restraint use in law states generally exceeded that in no law states regardless of age of child table in addition higher adult educational attainment was significantly associated with increased restraint use for children a factor that has also been associated with increased adult safety belt use reported by national center for injury prevention and control national center for chronic disease prevention and health promotion cdc editorial note the findings in this report are consistent with others indicating that adults who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to employ occupant restraints for their children because these nonbelted adults are at increased risk of crashing and more likely to exhibit other risk taking behaviors children traveling with them may be at greater risk for motor vehicle injury educational attainment of adult respondents was inversely associated with child restraint use in this report accordingly occupant protection programs should be promoted among parents with low educational attainment because low educational attainment is often associated with low socioeconomic status such programs should be offered to adults through health care facilities that serve low income communities or through federal programs i e head start that are directed at parents with young children injury prevention programs emphasize restraining young children in addition however efforts must be intensified to protect child occupants as hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april they become older parents especially those with low educational attainment those who do not consistently wear safety belts and those from states that do not have mandatory safety belt use laws should be encouraged to wear safety belts and to protect their children by using approved child safety seats and safety belts finally the increased use of restraints among children may increase their likelihood of using safety belts when they become teenagers the age group characterized by the

birth defects surveillance in metropolitan atlanta georgia and selected jurisdictions in california for the years description of system the california birth defects monitoring program and the metropolitan atlanta congenital defects program are two population based surveillance systems that employ similar data collection methods the prevalence estimates for diagnostic categories were based on data for for births in california and births in metropolitan atlanta the prevalences in the two areas were compared adjusting for race sex and maternal age by using poisson regression results regional differences in the prevalence of aortic stenosis fetal alcohol syndrome hip dislocation dysplasia microcephalus obstruction of the kidney ureter and scoliosis lordosis may be attributable to general diagnostic variability however differences in the prevalences of arm hand limb reduction encephalocele spina bifida or trisomy down syndrome are probably not attributable to differences in ascertainment because these defects are relatively easy to diagnose interpretation regional differences in prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy termination may affect prevalences of trisomy and spina bifida however the reason for differences in arm hand reduction is unknown but may be related to variability in environmental exposure heterogeneity in the gene pool or random variation actions taken because of the similarities of these data bases several collaborative studies are being implemented in particular the differences in the birth prevalence of spina bifida and down syndrome will focus

influenza s impact on mortality who collaborating laboratories reported weekly identification of influenza viruses weekly morbidity reports were received both from the state and territorial epidemiologists and from sentinel family practice physicians nonsystematic reports of outbreaks and unusual illnesses were received throughout the year results during the influenza season influenza a h n and b viruses were identified in the united states with essentially equal frequency overall although both regional and temporal patterns of predominance shifted over the course of the season throughout the season increases in the indices of influenza morbidity in regions where influenza a h n predominated were similar to increases in regions where influenza b predominated only of identified viruses were influenza a h n but isolations of this subtype increased as the season waned and it subsequently predominated during the season during the season outbreaks in nursing homes were reported in association with influenza b and a h n but not influenza a h n interpretation the alternating temporal and geographic predominance of influenza strains a h n and b during the season emphasizes the importance of continual attention to regional viral strain surveillance since amantadine is effective only for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza a actions taken weekly interim

of arizona high tech assisted reproductive technologies following the birth of the first in vitro fertilization embryo transfer ivf et baby in a host of assisted reproductive technologies have been developed that include ivf et gamete intrafallopian tube transfer gift embryo cryopreservation freezing and gamete micromanipulation together these technologies are referred to as the high tech assisted reproductive technology art procedures ovulation induction sperm insemination and surgery for tubal disease and or pathology still are the mainstays of the therapies available for infertility management however when these fail it almost always is appropriate to proceed with one of the art procedures therefore in addition to a comprehensive basic and general infertility service at the university of arizona center for reproductive endocrinology and infertility there is a program of assisted reproduction that specializes in art procedures this program serves as a tertiary provider for those patients in the state of arizona whose infertility problems cannot be resolved by the traditional therapies the following article on back describes the art procedures available in our center clarifies appropriate applications for each and considers the realistic expectations for their success procedures included are o in vitro o fertilization embryo transfer ivf et gamete intrafallopian tube transfer o gift cryopreservation of human embryos and gamete micromanipulation this article also considers ongoing research in our program that is directed towards improved success of these technologies hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april future areas of research in addition to ongoing research that is directed exclusively toward the management of infertile couples we are developing the technology to assist couples who are at risk for producing embryos with a serious hereditary disease this technology involves biopsying the preimplantation human embryo and then subjecting the biopsied cells to genetic analysis using either dna amplification or fluorescent in situ hybridization there are recent reports of the successful application of dna amplification by other centers for example for diagnosis of the genes for cystic fibrosis and hemophilia we hope to apply and further focus fluorescent in situ hybridization technology for probing the x chromosome the identification of which will provide a scientific basis for counselling patients who exhibit sex linked disorders the considerable clinical application of such technology lies in the fact that it circumvents the need for prenatal diagnosis in addition to the possibility of a subsequent termination of affected fetuses in order to avoid the birth of affected children catherine racowsky ph d associate professor and director of research department of obstetrics and gynecology college of medicine university of arizona tucson arizona applications success rates and advances for the management of infertility the following are the art procedures available at the university of arizona center for reproductive endocrinology and infertility in vitro fertilization embryo transfer is the core art procedure of our assisted reproduction program this procedure involves retrieval of unfertilized eggs from the ovary their insemination in vitro in a dish and the culture of resultant embryos for or days before they are transferred to the patient s uterus all cultures are maintained in an incubator under strictly controlled atmospheric and temperature conditions before being processed for use in insemination semen samples are evaluated in our andrology laboratory using both subjective light microscopy and computer hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april assisted semen analyses to ensure an adequate number of eggs with which to perform ivf et or indeed gift follicular development is typically stimulated with gonadotropins perganol metrodin gonadotropin releasing hormone gnrh factrel lutrepulse and or gnrh analogues lupron depo lupron synarel occasionally however ivf et is accomplished with eggs obtained in non stimulated cycles while some programs utilize laparoscopic egg retrieval in the operating room with the patient under general anesthesia we undertake the less costly approach of ultrasound guided retrieval in our infertility unit with the patient sedated couples who resort to ivf et exhibit such pathologies as tubal deficiencies ovulatory dysfunction endometriosis and or mild forms of male factor infertility according to the united states ivf registry the overall success rate for ivf et nationwide has stabilized at about percent per cycle results from our program involving patients who have undergone ivf et cycles reflect a comparable success rate nevertheless the overall incidence of success with this procedure is disconcertingly low and emphasizes the need to address those physiological factors that limit achievement of a higher percentage of pregnancies well recognized predictors of outcome include patient age response to exogenous ovarian stimulation quality of sperm and number of repeated ivf et cycle attempts however among these age is the single most significant determinant of conception therefore it is critical that such patients are referred to an assisted reproduction program at the earliest opportunity following failure of traditional therapies the underlying basis for the negative effect of age on fertility has not been clearly delineated beyond recognition that the number of eggs available for retrieval declines markedly with age fertilization rates significantly decrease in eggs retrieved from patients who are over years and provided the appropriate hormonal background is present age is unrelated to uterine competency to sustain pregnancy ongoing research in our center therefore is investigating physiological changes in the egg that may be impacted by age we have determined that more than percent of eggs that fail to fertilize in vitro are chromosomally abnormal and that a significant proportion of these abnormalities are accountable to patient age currently the only recourse for such patients is to use eggs obtained from a donor our program has initiated recruitment of volunteer egg donors to satisfy the needs of a list of recipients interested in this form of therapy gift this high tech art procedure is performed in the operating room usually with the use of a laparoscope and in contrast to ivf et involves introducing sperm and freshly retrieved eggs into the lumen of the fallopian tube an average of eggs tube under these circumstances fertilization occurs in vivo and if excess eggs are retrieved the remainder undergo ivf with subsequent options for embryo transfer in that cycle or freezing for transfer in a subsequent cycle this art procedure is applied to cases in hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april which there is at least one patent fallopian tube but the couple has such pathologies as ovulatory dysfunction endometriosis male factor infertility and or idiopathic infertility the data reported in the united states ivf registry for through indicate that the overall success rate with gift is higher than that obtained with the ivf et technique range of clinical pregnancies for gift is to percent and for ivf et to percent in view of this fact one might expect more patients to be treated with gift than ivf et however in our program we have taken into account three basic concerns which while substantially reducing the number of gift cycles performed benefit the patient these concerns are the increased costs associated with performing a procedure in the operating room the risks albeit minimal of undergoing general anesthesia and the considerable benefits to be accrued from obtaining direct information on the quality and fertilizability of the eggs and the developmental competency of resultant embryos the increased success with gift undoubtedly reflects the artificial environment provided by the laboratory in the ivf et procedure between january and december we have performed a total of gift cycles with an overall success rate of percent embryo cryopreservation or freezing is applied in our program when embryos result from residual gift eggs or from non transferred ivf embryos this procedure not only provides patients with a subsequent opportunity for success at much reduced costs but also circumvents the legal and ethical issues relating to disposal of supernumerary embryos therefore as stipulated by the american fertility society ethical guidelines for art programs from both a practical and an ethical standpoint all assisted reproduction programs should have the capability of cryopreserving human embrys gamete micromanipulation this art procedure which is still very new is applied to couples who are unaccepting of insemination with donor semen but who have severe male factor infertility less than million sperm ml in combination with fewer than perccent motile sperm and or less than percent sperm with normal morphology we are currently developing the procedure of sub zonal insertion szi which entails injecting sperm under the coating around the egg the barrier normally penetrated by the sperm through enzymatic digestion available data from szi programs world wide indicate that only to percent of szi cycles result in a pregnancy this statistic undoubtedly relates to limitations imposed by abnormalities inherent in the sperm therefore we are currently focusing on the development of improved techniques for the recognition and selection of sperm chosen for manipulation such efforts are unquestionably worthwhile in view of the fact that this technology offers the only realistic opportunity for severe male factor patients to establish conception catherine racowsky ph d hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april associate professor and director of research department

of allergy and infectious diseases niaid said we must address the question of how to treat people as early as we possibly can with drugs that are safe enough to give people for years and that will get around microbial resistance he said any delay would signify questions over safety and resistance rather than a lack of funds fauci who co authored one of the two papers published last week in nature rejects the argument by one of his co authors cecil fox that the new discovery indicates that billion spent on vaccine trials has been a waste of time and money because the trials were started too long after the patients were infected and were ended too quickly john tew of the medical college of virginia in richmond claims that the new evidence strongly backs the argument for early treatment of

for five years but we re glad it is now in the public domain said jesse dobson of the california based project inform but peter duesberg who believes that aids is independent of hiv and is a result of drug abuse in the west said we are several paradoxes away from an explanation of aids even if these papers are right april risk of aids virus from doctors found to be minimal washington post p a the risk of hiv being transmitted from infected health care professionals to patients is minimal according to new research published in today s journal of the american medical association jama this finding supports previous conclusions by health experts that the chance of contracting hiv from a health care worker is remote three studies in the jama demonstrate that thousands of patients were treated by two hiv positive surgeons and dentists without becoming infected with the virus the studies were conducted by separate research teams in new hampshire maryland and florida each study started with an hiv positive doctor or dentist and tested all patients willing to participate the new hampshire study found that none of the patients who had undergone invasive procedures by an hiv

details several reasons for the concerted interest that all countries share in combating aids it should be noted that while aids leads in hastening global health interdependence it is not the only illness doing so diseases such as malaria and many respiratory and intestinal pathogens have similarly inhibited the economic development of most of humanity and acted to marginalize large populations berkley mentions the enormous social and economic impact that aids will have on many developing countries and the increased need for international assistance that will result berkley also cites the lack of political aggressiveness toward the aids epidemic in its first decade but now there is a new administration with a promise of substantial differences in approach to international health and development in general and hiv aids in particular vice president al gore proposes in his book earth in the balance a major environmental initiative that includes sustainable international development with programs to promote literacy improve child survival and disseminate contraceptive technology and access throughout the developing world if enacted this change in policy could drastically change the future of worldwide health aids and priorities in the global village in reply journal of the american hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april medical association vol no p berkley seth every nation should tackle hiv as early and aggressively as possible before the disease reaches an endemic state even at a cost of diverting less attention to some other illnesses writes seth berkley of the rockefeller foundation in new york n y in reply to a letter by drs gellert and nordenberg although it is true that diseases other than aids such as malaria and respiratory and intestinal illnesses have similarly inhibited economic development in developing countries and deserve much more attention than they are getting berkley disagrees with the contention that aids is receiving too much attention hiv differs from other diseases in most developing countries because it is continuing to spread for most endemic diseases the outcome of neglecting interventions for one year is another year of about the same level of needless disease and death but with aids and its increasing spread the cost of neglect not only in disease burden but financially is much greater interventions in the early part of a rampantly spreading epidemic like hiv are highly cost effective because each individual infection prevented significantly interrupts transmission berkley says he agrees with gellert and nordenberg about the gigantic social and economic effects of aids and about the need for political leadership but he concludes that not only is assertive political leadership needed in the united states for the aids epidemic but even more so in developing countries with high rates of hiv infection and where complacency about the epidemic has been the rule hicnet medical newsletter page volume

secretary donna e shalala said this initial study can be seen as a hopeful milestone in our efforts to ameliorate the tragedy of hiv infected children who now face the certainty they will develop aids anthony s fauci m d director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases and of the nih office of aids research said the trial is the first step in finding out whether vaccines can help prevent or delay disease progression in children with hiv who are not yet sick if these vaccines prove to be safe more sophisticated questions about their therapeutic potential will be assessed in phase ii trials the centers for disease control and prevention estimates children in the united states have hiv by the end of the decade the world health organization projects million children will

country and three sites participating in the actg but funded by the national institute of child health and human development preliminary evidence from similar studies under way in infected adults shows that certain vaccines can boost existing hiv specific immune responses and hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april stimulate new ones it will be several years however before researchers know how these responses affect the clinical course of the disease the results from the pediatric trial known as actg will be examined closely for other reasons as well this trial will provide the first insight into how the immature immune system responds to candidate hiv vaccines said daniel hoth m d director of niaid s division of aids we need this information to design trials to test whether experimental vaccines can prevent hiv infection in children in the united states most hiv infected children live in poor inner city areas and more than percent are minorities mainly black or hispanic nearly all hiv infected children acquire the virus from their mothers during pregnancy or at birth an infected mother in the united states has more than a one in four chance of transmitting the virus to her baby as growing numbers of women of childbearing age become exposed to hiv through injection drug use or infected sexual partners researchers expect a corresponding increase in the numbers of infected children hiv disease progresses more rapidly in infants and children than in adults the most recent information suggests that percent of infants born with hiv develop a serious aids related infection by to years of age these infections include severe or frequent bouts of common bacterial illnesses of childhood that can result in seizures pneumonia diarrhea and other symptoms leading to nutritional problems and long hospital stays at least half of the children in the trial will be years of age or younger to enable comparison of the immune responses of the younger and older participants all volunteers must have well documented hiv infection but no symptoms of hiv disease other than swollen lymph glands or a mildly swollen liver or spleen they cannot

chair samuel katz m d of duke university school of medicine will coordinate the trial assisted by james mcnamara m d medical officer in the pediatric medicine branch of niaid s division of aids we will compare the safety of the vaccines by closely monitoring the children for any side effects to see if one vaccine produces more swollen arms or fevers for example than another said dr mcnamara we ll also look at whether low or high doses of the vaccines stimulate immune responses or other significant laboratory or clinical effects he emphasized that the small study size precludes comparing these responses or effects among the three hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april products the trial will test two doses each of three experimental vaccines made from recombinant hiv proteins these so called subunit vaccines each genetically engineered to contain only a piece of the virus have so far proved well tolerated in ongoing trials in hiv infected adults one vaccine made

independently of its ability to suppress the immune system say scientists at the national institues of health they report that hiv itself not an opportunistic infection caused scaling skin conditions to develop in mice carrying the genes for hiv although the hiv genes were active in the mice they did not compromise the animals immunity the researchers found this led them to conclude that the hiv itself caused the skin disease our findings support a growing body of evidence that hiv can cause disease without affecting the immune system said lead author dr jeffrey kopp of the national institute of dental research nidr dr kopp and his colleagues described their study in the march issue of aids research and human retroviruses developing animal models of hiv infection has been difficult since most animals including mice cannot be infected by the virus to bypass this problem scientists have developed hiv transgenic mice which carry genes for hiv as well as their own genetic material nidr scientists created the transgenic mice by injecting hiv genes into mouse eggs and then implanting the eggs into female mice the resulting litters contained both normal and transgenic animals institute scientists had created mice that carried a complete copy of hiv genetic material in l those mice however became sick and died too soon after birth to study in depth in the present study the scientists used an incomplete copy of hiv which allowed the animals to live longer some of the transgenic animals developed scaling wart like tumors on their necks and backs other transgenic mice developed thickened crusting skin lesions that covered most of their bodies resembling psoriasis in humans no skin lesions developed in their normal non transgenic littermates studies of tissue taken from the wart like skin tumors showed that they were a type of noncancerous tumor called papilloma although the papillomavirus can cause these skin lesions laboratory tests showed no sign of that virus in the animals tissue samples taken from the sick mice throughout the study revealed the presence of a protein producing molecule made by the hiv genetic material hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april evidence of hiv protein production proved that the viral genes were turned on or active said dr kopp the scientists found no evidence however of compromised immunity in the mice no increase in their white blood cell count and no signs of common infections the fact that hiv genes were active but the animals immune systems were not suppressed confirms that the virus itself was causing the skin lesions dr kopp said further proof of hiv gene involvement came from a test in which the scientists exposed the transgenic animals to ultraviolet light the light increased hiv genetic activity causing papillomas to develop on formerly healthy skin papilloma formation in response to increased hiv genetic activity proved the genes were responsible for the skin condition the scientists said no lesions appeared on normal mice exposed to the uv light the transgenic mice used in this study were developed at nidr by dr peter dickie who is now with the national institute of allergy and

s u s department of health and human services march hhs secretary donna e shalala today announced the first nationwide clinical consultation telephone service for doctors and other health care professionals who have questions about providing care to people with hiv infection or aids the toll free national hiv telephone consulting service is staffed by a physician a nurse practitioner and a pharmacist it provides information on drugs clinical trials and the latest treatment methods the service is funded by the health resources and services administration and operates out of san francisco general hospital secretary shalala said one goal of this project is to share expertise so patients get the best care a second goal is to get more primary health care providers involved in care for people with hiv or aids which reduces treatment cost by allowing patients to remain with their medical providers and community social support networks currently many providers refer patients with hiv or aids to specialists or other providers who have more experience secretary shalala said this clinical expertise should be especially helpful for physicians and providers who treat people with hiv or aids in communities and clinical sites where hiv expertise is not readily available the telephone number for health care professionals is and it is accessible from a m to p m est a m to p m pst monday through friday during these times consultants will try to answer questions immediately or within an hour at other times physicians and health care providers can leave an electronic message and questions will be answered as quickly as possible health care professionals may call the service to ask any question related to providing hiv care including the latest hiv aids drug treatment information clinical trials information subspecialty case referral literature searches and other information the service is designed for health care professionals rather than patients families or others who have alternate sources of information or materials when a health care professional calls the new service the call is taken by either a clinical pharmacist primary care physician or family nurse practitioner all staff members have extensive experience in outpatient and inpatient primary care for people with hiv related diseases the consultant asks for patient specific information including cd cell count current medications sex age and the patient s hiv history this national service has grown out of a month local effort that hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april responded to nearly calls from health care providers in northern california the initial project was funded by hrsa s bureau of health professions through its community provider aids training cpat project and by the american academy of family physicians when providers expand their knowledge they also improve the quality of care they are able to provide to their patients said hrsa administrator robert g harmon m d m p h this project will be a great resource for health care professionals and the hiv aids patients they serve this service has opened a new means of communication between health care professionals and experts on hiv care management said hrsa s associate administrator for aids and director of the bureau of health resources development g stephen bowen m d m p h providers who treat people with hiv or aids have access to the latest information on new drugs treatment methods and therapies for people with hiv or aids hrsa is one of eight u s public health service agencies

thank you to the following individuals whose contributions i just received john sorenson carol sigelman carla moore barbara moose judith schrier again thank you to all who gave i have been using wordscan plus for the past couple of weeks and would like to review the product wordscan plus is a product of calera recognition systems it runs under windows and supports that accufont technology of the hewlett packard scanners when initially bringing up the software it lets you select several options text graphics input source ie scanner fax file disk file automatic versus manual decomposition of the scanned image i like manual decomposition since the software then lets me select which parts of the document i would like scanned and in what order once an image is scanned you can bring up the pop up image verification the software gives you two errors at this point blue which are words that were converted reliability but do not match anything in the built in dictionary yellow shade which are words that wordscan plus doesn t think it converted correctly at all i have found that the software should give itself more credit it is usually correct instead of wrong if a word is shaded blue you can add it to your personal dictionary the only problem is the personal dictionary will only handle about words i find this to be very limited considering how many medical terms are not in a normal dictionary after a document is converted you can save it in a multitude of word processor formats also any images that were captured can be stored in a seperate tiff or pcx file format i was extremely impressed on the percent accuracy for fax files i use hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april an intel satisfaxtion card which stores incoming faxs in a pcx dcx format while most of my faxes were received in standard mode x dpi the accuracy of wordscan plus was excellent overall a very impressive product the only fault i could find is the limitations of the size of the user

problem infectious diseases remain the major cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of illness and death in the united states since the early s the u s public health system has been challenged by a myriad of newly identified pathogens and syndromes e g escherichia coli o h hepatitis c virus human immunodeficiency virus legionnaires disease lyme disease and toxic shock syndrome the incidences of many diseases widely presumed to be under control such as cholera malaria and tuberculosis tb have increased in many areas furthermore control and prevention of infectious diseases are undermined by drug resistance in conditions such as gonorrhea malaria pneumococcal disease salmonellosis shigellosis tb and staphylococcal infections emerging infections place a disproportionate burden on immunocompromised persons those in institutional settings e g hospitals and child day care centers and minority and underserved populations the substantial economic burden of emerging infections on the u s health care system could be reduced by more effective surveillance systems and targeted control and prevention programs this issue of mmwr introduces a new series emerging

center for infectious diseases cdc editorial note e coli o h is a pathogenic gram negative bacterium first identified as a cause of illness in during an outbreak of severe bloody diarrhea traced to contaminated hamburgers this pathogen has since emerged as an important cause of both bloody diarrhea and hus the most common cause of acute renal failure in children outbreak investigations have linked most cases with the consumption of undercooked ground beef although other food vehicles including roast beef raw milk and apple cider also have been implicated preliminary data from a cdc year nationwide multicenter study revealed that when stools were routinely cultured for e coli o h that organism was isolated more frequently than shigella in four of participating hospitals and was isolated from of all bloody stools a higher rate than for any other pathogen infection with e coli o h often is not recognized because most clinical laboratories do not routinely culture stools for this organism on hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april smac medium and many clinicians are unaware of the spectrum of illnesses associated with infection the usual clinical manifestations are diarrhea often bloody and abdominal cramps fever is infrequent younger age groups and the elderly are at highest risk for clinical manifestations and complications illness usually resolves after days but of patients develop hus which is characterized by hemolytic anemia thrombocytopenia renal failure and a death rate of this report illustrates the difficulties in recognizing community outbreaks of e coli o h in the absence of routine surveillance despite the magnitude of this outbreak the problem may not have been recognized in three states if the epidemiologic link had not been established in washington clinical laboratories should routinely culture stool specimens from persons with bloody diarrhea or hus for e coli o h using smac agar when infections with e coli o h are identified they should be reported to local health departments for further evaluation and if necessary public health action to prevent further cases e coli o h lives in the intestines of healthy cattle and can contaminate meat during slaughter cdc is collaborating with the u s department of agriculture s food safety inspection service to identify critical control points in processing as a component of a program to reduce the likelihood of pathogens such as e coli o h entering the meat supply because slaughtering practices can result in contamination of raw meat with pathogens and because the process of grinding beef may transfer pathogens from the surface of the meat to the interior ground beef is likely to be internally contaminated the optimal food protection practice is to cook ground beef thoroughly until the interior is no longer pink and the juices are clear in this outbreak undercooking of hamburger patties likely played an important role the food and drug administration fda has issued interim recommendations to increase the internal temperature for cooked hamburgers to f c fda personal communication regulatory actions stimulated by the outbreak described in this report and the recovery of thousands of contaminated patties before they could be consumed emphasize the value of rapid public health investigations of outbreaks the public health impact and increasing frequency of isolation of this pathogen underscore the need for improved surveillance for infections caused by e coli o h and for hus to better define the epidemiology of e coli

oral cancer and other mouth disorders differences in the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use among racial ethnic groups may be influenced by differences in educational levels and socioeconomic status as well as social and cultural phenomena that require further explanation for example targeted marketing practices may play a role in maintaining or increasing prevalence among some groups and

linked to serious asthma attacks american lung association a new study published by the american lung association has shown that surprisingly low concentrations of airborne particles can send people with asthma rushing to emergency rooms for treatment the seattle based study showed that roughly one in eight emergency visits for asthma in that city was linked to exposure to particulate air pollution the actual exposure levels recorded in the study were far below those deemed unsafe under federal air quality laws people with asthma have inflamed airways and airborne particles tend to exacerbate that inflammation said joel schwartz ph d of the environmental protection agency who was the lead author of the study when people are on the threshold of having a serious asthma attack particles can push them over the edge the seattle study correlated months of asthma emergency room visits with daily levels of pm or particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of microns or less these finer particles are considered hazardous because they are small enough penetrate into the lung cities are considered out of compliance with clean air laws if the hour average concentration of pm exceeds micrograms per cubic millimeter of air in seattle however a link between fine particles and asthma was found at levels as low as micrograms the authors concluded that for every microgram increase in the four day average of pm the odds of someone with asthma needing emergency treatment increased by percent the findings were published in the april american review of respiratory disease an official journal of the american thoracic society the lung association s medical section the study is the latest in a series of recent reports to suggest that particulate matter is a greatly under appreciated health threat a study by dr schwartz and douglas dockery ph d of harvard found that particles may be causing roughly premature deaths each year in the united states other studies have linked particulate matter to increased respiratory symptoms and bronchitis in children government officials and the media are still very focused on ozone says dr schwartz but more and more research is showing that particles are bad actors as well one problem in setting standards for particulate air pollution is that pmio is difficult to study unlike other regulated pollutants such as ozone and carbon monoxide particulate matter is a complex and varying mixture of substances including carbon hydrocarbons dust and hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april acid aerosols researchers can t put people in exposure chambers to study the effects of particulate air pollution says dr schwartz we have no way of duplicating the typical urban mix of particles consequently most of what is known about particulates has been learned through population based research like the seattle study given that the epa s current priority is to review the ozone and sulfur dioxide standards the agency is unlikely to reexamine the pm standard any time soon until changes are made there appears to be little people with asthma can do to protect themselves from airborne particles in some areas you can get reports on air quality but the reports only cover the pollutant that is closest to violating its standard and that s rarely particulate matter says dr schwartz however pm doesn t have to be near its violation range to be unhealthy hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april nih consensus development conference on melanoma the national institutes of health consensus development

efforts to reduce cancer incidence morbidity and mortality within the program there are four types of cancer centers basic science cancer centers which engage primarily in basic cancer research clinical cancer centers which focus on clinical research comprehensive cancer centers which emphasize a multidisciplinary approach to cancer research patient care and community outreach and consortium cancer centers which specialize in cancer prevention and control research although some cancer centers existed in the late s and the s it was the national cancer act of that authorized the establishment of new cancer centers as well as continuing support for existing ones the passage of the act also dramatically transformed the centers structure and broadened the scope of their mission to include all aspects of basic clinical and cancer control research over the next two decades the centers program grew progressively in there were comprehensive cancer centers in the nation today there are of these institutions all of which meet specific nci criteria for comprehensive status to attain recognition from the nci as a comprehensive cancer center an institution must pass rigorous peer review under guidelines newly established in the eight criteria for comprehensiveness include the requirement that a center have a strong core of basic laboratory research in several scientific fields such as biology and molecular genetics a strong program of clinical research and an ability to transfer research findings into clinical practice moreover five of the criteria for comprehensive status go significantly beyond that required for attaining a cancer center support grant also referred to as a p or core grant the mechanism of choice for supporting the infrastructure of a cancer center s operations these criteria encompass strong participation in nci designated high priority clinical trials significant levels of cancer prevention and control research and important outreach and educational activities all of which are funded by a variety of sources the other types of cancer centers also have special characteristics and capabilities for organizing new programs of research that can exploit important new findings or address timely research questions hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april of the nci designated cancer centers are of the basic science type these centers engage almost entirely in basic research although some centers engage in collaborative research with outside clinical research investigators and in cooperative projects with industry to generate medical applications from new discoveries in the laboratory clinical cancer centers in contrast focus on both basic research and clinical research within the same institutional framework and frequently incorporate nearby affiliated clinical research institutions into their overall research programs there are such centers today finally consortium cancer centers of which there is one are uniquely structured and concentrate on clinical research and cancer prevention and control research these centers interface with state and local public health departments for the purpose of achieving the transfer of effective prevention and control techniques from their research findings to those institutions responsible for implementing population wide public health programs consortium centers also are heavily engaged in collaborations with institutions that conduct clinical trial research and coordinate community hospitals within a network of cooperating institutions in clinical trials together the nci designated cancer centers continue to work toward creating new and innovative approaches to cancer research and through interdisciplinary efforts to effectively move this research

vaccine administration sources said thursday the decision ends the controversy between army aids researchers who had hoped to test a vaccine made by microgenesys inc and the national institutes of health which contended that multiple vaccines should be tested health and human services secretary donna shalala said a final announcement on the therapeutic vaccine trials was expected to be made last friday companies including genentech inc chiron corp and immuno ag have already told nih that they are prepared to participate in the vaccine tests the testing is intended to demonstrate whether aids vaccines are effective in thwarting the replication of hiv in patients already infected shalala refuted last week s reports that the clinton administration had decided the army s test of the microgenesys vaxsyn should proceed without tests of others at the same time the report was inaccurate and i expect there to be some announcement in the next hours about that particular aids research project said shalala administration sources subsequently confirmed that nih director dr bernadine healy and food and drug administration commissioner david kessler had convinced the white house that multiple vaccines should be tested simultaneously but microgenesys president frank volvovitz said a test of multiple vaccines could triple the cost of the trial and delay it by two years hicnet

noordewier rutgers university this overview of the essential facts of molecular biology is intended as an introduction to the field for computer scientists who wish to apply their tools to this rich and complex domain material covered will include structural and informational molecules the basic organization of the cell and of genetic material the central dogma of gene expression and selected other topics in the area of structure function and regulation as relates to current computational approaches dr noordewier has appointments in both computer science and biology at rutgers and has extensive experience in basic biological research in addition to his current work in computational biology pm introduction to artificial intelligence for biologists dr richard lathrop mit arris corp an overview of the field of artificial intelligence will be presented as it relates to actual and potential biological applications fundamental techniques symbolic programming languages and notions of search will be discussed as well as selected topics in somewhat greater detail such as knowledge representation inference and machine learning the intended audience includes biologists with some computational background but no extensive exposure to artificial intelligence dr lathrop co developer of ariadne and related technologies has worked in the area of artificial intelligence applied to biological problems in both academia and industry pm neural networks statistics and information theory in biological sequence analysis dr alan lapedes los alamos national laboratory this tutorial will cover the most rapidly expanding facet of intelligent systems for molecular biology that of machine learning techniques applied to sequence analysis closely interrelated topics to be addressed include the use of artifical neural networks to elicit both specific signals and general characteristics of sequences and the relationship of such approaches to statistical techniques and information theoretic views of sequence data dr lapedes of the theoretical division at los alamos has long been a leader in the use of such techniques in this domain pm genetic algorithms and genetic programming prof john koza stanford university the genetic algorithm an increasingly popular approach to highly non linear multi dimensional optimization problems was originally inspired by a biological metaphor this tutorial will cover both the biological motivations and the actual implementation and characteristics of the algorithm genetic programming an extension well suited to problems where the discovery of the size and shape of the solution is a major part of the problem will also be addressed particular attention will be paid to biological applications and to identifying resources and software that will permit attendees to begin using the methods dr koza a consulting professor of computer science at stanford has taught this subject since and is the author of a standard text in the field pm linguistic methods in sequence analysis prof david searls university of pennsylvania shmuel pietrokovski weizmann institute approaches to sequence analysis based on linguistic methodologies are increasingly in evidence these involve the adaptation of tools and techniques from computational linguistics for syntactic pattern recognition and gene prediction the classification of genetic structures and phenomena using formal language theory the identification of significant vocabularies and overlapping codes in sequence data and sequence comparison reflecting taxonomic and functional relatedness dr searls who holds research faculty appointments in both genetics and computer science at penn represents the branch of this field that considers higher order syntactic approaches to sequence data while shmuel pietrokovski has studied and published with prof edward trifinov in the area of word based analyses registration form mail with check made out to ismb to ismb conference c o

sci.med	candida yeast bloom fact or fiction i can not believe the way this thread on candida yeast has progressed steve dyer and i have been exchanging words over the same topic in sci med nutrition when he displayed his typical reserve and attacked a women poster for being treated by a liscenced physician for a disease that did not exist calling this physician a quack was reprehensible steve and i see that you and some of the others are doing it here as well let me tell you who the quacks really are these are the physicans who have no idea how the human body interacts with it s environment and how that balance can be altered by diet and antibiotics these are the physicians who dismiss their patients with difficult symptomatology and make them go from doctor to doctor to find relief like elaine in sci med nutrition and then when they find one that solves their problem the rest start yelling quack could it just be professional jealousy i couldn t help elaine or jon but somebody else did could they know more than me no way they must be a quack i ve been teaching a human nutrition course for medical students for over ten years now and guess who the most receptive students are those that were raised on farms and saw first hand the effect of diet on the health of their farm animals and those students who had made a dramatic diet change prior to entering medical school switched to the vegan diet typically this is about of my class of students those not interested in nutrition either tune me out or just stop coming to class that s okay because i know that some of what i m teaching is going to stick and there will be at least a few enlightened physicians practicing in the u s it s really too bad that most u s medical schools don t cover nutrition because if they did candida would not be viewed as a non disease by so many in the medical profession in animal husbandry an animal is reinnoculated with good bacteria after antibiotics are stopped medicine has decided that since humans do not have a ruminant stomach no such reinnoculation with good bacteria is needed after coming off a braod spectrum antibiotic humans have all kinds of different organisms living in the gi system mouth stomach small and large intestine sinuses vagina and on the skin these are nonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immune system is compromised they are also called nonpathogens because unlike the pathogenic organisms that cause human disease they do not produce toxins as they live out their merry existence in and on our body but any of these organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up residence within the body a poor mucus membrane barrier can let this happen and vitamin a is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier steve got real upset with elaine s doctor because he was using anti fungals and vitamin a for her gi problems if steve really understoood what vitamin a does in the body he would not or at least should not be calling elaine s doctor a quack here is a brief primer on yeast yeast infections as they are commonly called are not truely caused by yeasts the most common organism responsible for this type of infection is candida albicans or monilia which is actually a yeast like fungus an infection caused by this organism is called candidiasis candidiasis is a very rare occurance because like an e coli infection it requires that the host immune system be severly depressed candida is frequently found on the skin and all of the mucous membranes of normal healthy people and it rarely becomes a problem unless some predisposing factor is present such as a high blood glucose level diabetes or an oral course of antibiotics has been used in diabetics their secretions contain much higher amounts of glucose candida unlike bacteria is very limited in it s food fuel selection without glucose it can not grow it just barely survives if it gets access to a lot of glucose it blooms and over rides the other organisms living with it in the sinuses gi tract or vagina in diabetics skin lesions can also foster a good bloom site for these little buggers the bloom is usually just a minor irritant in most people but some people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus membrane or skin bloom site whether this is an allergic like reaction to the candida or not isn t certain when the bloom is in the vagina or on the skin it can be easliy seen and some doctors do then try to treat it if it s internal only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty nondiscript candida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in the sinuses the gi tract mouth stomach and intestines and in the vaginal tract which compete with it for food the human immune system ususally does not bother itself with these nonpathogenic organisms unless they broach the mucus membrane barrier if they do an inflammatory response will be set up most americans are not getting enough vitamin a from their diets about of all american s die with less vitamin a than they were born with u s autopsy studies while this low level of vitamin a does not cause pathology blindness it does impair the mucus membrane barrier system this would then be a predisposing factor for a strong inflammatory response after a candida bloom while diabetics can suffer from a candida bloom the most common cause of this type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which knock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main competition for candida as far as food is concerned while drugs are available to handle candida many patients find that their doctor will not use them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection the toxicity of the anti fungal drugs does warrant some caution but if the gi or sinus inflammation is suspected to be candida and recent use of a broad spectrum antibiotic is the smoking gun then anti fungal use should be approrpriate just as the anti fungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring vaginal yeast infections in spite of what mr steve dyer says but even in patients being given the anti fungals the irritation caused by the excessive candida bloom in the sinus gi tract or the vagina tends to return after drug treatment is discontinued unless the underlying cause of the problem is addressed lack of a good bacterial flora in the body and or poor mucus membrane barrier lactobacillus acidophilus is the most effective therapy for candida overgrowth from it s name it is an acid loving organism and it sets up an acidic condition were it grows candida can not grow very well in an acidic environment in the vagina l acidophilius is the predominate bacteria unless you are hit with broad spectrum antibiotics in the gi system the ano rectal region seems to be a particularly good reservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very favorable environment around the rectum for transfer through moisture and humidity of candida to the vaginal tract one of the most effctive ways to minimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear if the bloom occurs in the anal area the burning swelling pain and even blood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids if the bloom manages to move further up the gi tract very diffuse symptomatology occurs abdominal discomfort and blood in the stool this positive stool for occult blood is what sent elaine to her family doctor in the first place after extensive testing he told her that there was nothing wrong but her gut still hurt on to another doctor and so on richard kaplan has told me throiugh e mail that he considers occult blood tests in stool specimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of false positives candida blooms guys if my gut hurt me on a constant basis i would want it fixed yes it s nice to know that i don t have colon cancer but what then is causing my distress when i finally find a doctor who treats me and gets me better steve dyer calls him a quack candida prefers a slightly alkaline environment while bacteria tend to prefer a slightly acidic environment the vagina becomes alkaline during a woman s period and this is often when candida blooms in the vagina vinegar and water douches are the best way of dealing with vaginal problems many women have also gotten relief from the introduction of lactobacillus directly into the vaginal tract i would want to be sure of the purity of the product before trying this my wife had this vagina problem after going on birth control pills and searched for over a year until she found a gynocologist who solved the problem rather than just writting scripts for anti fungal creams this was a woman gynocologist who had had the same problem recurring vaginal yeast infections this m d did some digging and came up with an acetic acid and l acidophilis douche which she used in your office to keep it sterile after three treatments sex returned to our marraige i have often wondered what an m d with chronic gi distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his patients is a non existent syndrome the nonpathogenic bacteria l acidophilus is an acid producing bacteria which is the most common bacteria found in the vaginal tract of healthy women if taken orally it can also become a major bacteria in the gut through aresol sprays it has also been used to innoculate the sinus membranes but before this innoculation occurs the mucus membrane barrier system needs to be strengthened this is accomplished by vitamin a vitamin c and some of the b complex vitamins diet surveys repeatedly show that americans are not getting enough b and folate these are probably the segement of the population that will have the greatest problem with this non existent disorder candida blooms after antibiotic therapy some of the above material was obtained from natural healing by mark bricklin published by rodale press as well as notes from my human nutrition course i will be posting a discussion of vitamin a sometime in the future along with reference citings to point out the extremely important role that vitamin a plays in the mucus membrane defense system in the body and why vitamin a should be effective in dealing with candida blooms another effective dietary treatment is to restrict carbohydrate intake during the treatment phase this is especially important if the gi system is involved if candida can not get glucose it s not going to out grow the bacteria and you then give bacteria which can use amino acids and fatty acids for energy a chance to take over and keep the candida in check once carbohydrate is returned to the gut if steve and some of the other nay sayers want to jump all over this post fine i jumped all over steve in sci med nutrition because he verbably accosted a poster who was seeking advice about her doctor s use of vitamin a and anti fungals for a candida bloom in her gut people seeking advice from newsnet should not be treated this way those of us giving of our time and knowledge can slug it out to our heart s content

the replies if any will be med related in article banschbach vms ocom okstate edu writes i can not believe the way this thread on candida yeast has progressed steve dyer and i have been exchanging words over the same topic in sci med nutrition when he displayed his typical reserve and attacked a woman poster for being treated by a licenced physician for a disease that did not exist calling this physician a quack was reprehensible steve and i see that you and some of the others are doing it here as well they are just responding in their natural way hyper choleric syndrome hcs oops that is not a recognized illness in the psychological community better not say that since it therefore must not and never will exist actually it is fascinating that a disproportionate number of physicians will type out as nt for those not familiar with the myers briggs system just e mail me and i ll send a summary file to you in the general population nt s comprise only about of the population but among physicians it is much much higher i don t know the exact percentage any help here a p p er s one driving characteristic of an nt especially an ntj is their obvious choleric behavior driver type a etc the extreme emotional need to control to lead and or to be the best or the most competent if they are also extroverted they are best described as field marshalls this trait is very valuable and essential in our society we need people who want to lead to strive to overcome the elements to seek and thirst for knowledge to raise the level of competency etc the great successes in science and technology are in large part due to the vision an n trait and scientifically minded approach t trait of the nt personality of course the other types and temperaments have their own positive contributions as well however when the nt person has self image challenges the dark side of this personality type usually comes out which should be obvious to all a physician who is a strong nt and who has not learned to temper their temperament will be extremely business like lack of empathy or feeling and is very compelled to have total control over their patient the patient must be obedient to their diagnosis and prescription without question i ve known many m d s of this temperament and suffice to say i don t oblige them with a followup visit no matter how competent i think they are and they usually are very competent from a knowledge viewpoint since that is an extreme drive of theirs to know the most to know it all maybe we need more nf doctor s enough on this subject let s move on to candida bloom let me tell you who the quacks really are these are the physicans who have no idea how the human body interacts with it s environment and how that balance can be altered by diet and antibiotics could it just be professional jealousy i couldn t help elaine or jon but somebody else did you ve helped me already by your post of course i believe that i have been misdiagnosed on the net as suffering from anal retentivitis but being the phlegmatic i am maybe i was just a little too harsh on a few people myself in past posts let s all try to raise the level of this discussion above the level of anal effluent humans have all kinds of different organisms living in the gi system mouth stomach small and large intestine sinuses vagina and on the skin these are nonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immune system is compromised they are also called nonpathogens because unlike the pathogenic organisms that cause human disease they do not produce toxins as they live out their merry existence in and on our body but any of these organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up residence within the body a poor mucus membrane barrier can let this happen and vitamin a is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier in my well described situation in prior posts i definitely was immune stressed blood tests showed my vitamin a levels were very low my sinuses were a mess no doubt the mucosal lining and the cilia were heavily damaged i also was on antibiotics times in years in the end even two weeks of ceftin did not work and i had confirmed diagnoses of a chronic bacterial infection of the sinuses via cat scans mucus color won t get into the details and other symptoms three very traditional ent s made this diagnosis i did not have any cultures done however because of the difficulty of doing this right and because my other symptoms clearly showed a bacterial infection enough of this background provided to help you understand where i was when i make comments about my sporanox anti fungal therapy below the first question i have is this can fungus penetrate a little way into poor mucus membrane tissue maybe via hyphae thus causing symptoms without being considered systemic in the classic sense it is sort of an inbetween infection steve got real upset with elaine s doctor because he was using anti fungals and vitamin a for her gi problems if steve really understoood what vitamin a does in the body he would not or at least should not be calling elaine s doctor a quack i was concerned too because of the toxicity of vitamin a my doctor after my blood tests put me on iu of vitamin a for one week only then dropped it down to iu for the next couple of weeks i also received zinc and other supplementation since all of these interrelate in fairly complex ways as my doctor explained he s one of those evil orthomolecular specialists i had a blood test three weeks later and vitamin a was normal he then stopped me on all vitamin a except for some in a multi vitamin supplement and made sure that i maintain a iu day of beta carotene call me carrot face hopefully elaine s doctor will take a similar careful approach and to all supplements i m even reevaluating some supplements i m taking for example niacin in fairly large dosages gram day which steve dyer had good information about on sci med nutrition if niacin only has second order improvement in symptomatic relief of my sinus allergies then it probably is not worth taking such a large dose long term and risking liver damage survives if it gets access to a lot of glucose it blooms and over rides the other organisms living with it in the sinuses gi tract or vagina in though i do now believe based on my successful therapy with sporanox that i definitely had some excessive growth of fungus unknown species in my sinuses i still want to ask the question have there been any studies that demonstrate candida blooms in the sinuses with associated sinus irritation sinusitis rhinitis my sinus irritation reduced significantly after one week of sporanox and no other new treatments were implemented during this time i did not have any noticeable gi track problems before starting on sporanox but some for a few days after which then went away considered normal btw my doctor dug out one of his medical reference books sorry can t remember which one and found an obscure comment dating back into the s which stated that people can develop contained non lethal or non serious aspergillis infestations aspergiliosis of the sinuses leading to sinus inflammation symptoms i ll have to dig out that reference again since it is relevant to this discussion some people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus membrane or skin bloom site whether this is an allergic like reaction to the candida or not isn t certain my doctor tested me i believe a rast or rast similar test for allergic response to specificially candida albicans and i showed a strong positive another question would everybody show the same strong positive so this test is essentially useless and assuming it is true that candida can grow part way into the mucus membrane tissue and the concentration exceeds a threshold amount could not a person who tests as having an allergy to candida definitely develop allergic symptoms such as mucus membrane irritation due to the body s allergic response as i said in an earlier post one does not need to be a rocket scientist or have a m d degree or a ph d in biochemistry to see the plausibility of this hypothesis btw and i ll repost this again dr ivker in his book sinus survival has routinely given before anything else nizoral a pre sporanox systemic anti fungal not as safe and not as good as sporanox to his new chronic sinusitis patients if they have been on antibiotics four or more times in the last two years he claims that out of or so patients well over notice some relief of sinus inflammation and other symptoms but it doesn t cure it by any means implying the so called yeast fungus infection is not the primary cause but a later complication he s also found that nystatin whether taken internally or put into a sinus spray does not help this implies of course assuming that excessive yeast fungus bloom is aggravating the sinus inflammation that the yeast fungus has grown partway into the tissue since nystatin will not kill yeast fungus other than by direct contact it is not absorbed into the blood stream again i admit lots of ifs and implies which doesn t please the hard core nt who has to have the double blind study or it s a non issue but one has to start with some plausible hypothesis explanation a strawman if you will if it s internal only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty nondescript this brings up an interesting observation used by those who will deny and reject any and all aspects of the yeast hypothesis until the appropriate studies are done and that is if you can t observe or culture the yeast bloom in the gut or sinus then there s no way to diagnose or even recognize the disease and i know they realize that it is virtually impossible to test for candida overbloom in any part of the body that cannot be easily observed since candida is everywhere in the body it s a real catch another catch those who totally reject the yeast hypothesis say that no studies have been done actually studies have been done but if it s not up to a certain standard then it is from their perspective a non study which should not even be considered i agree that the appropriate studies should be done and that will take big to do it right however in order to convince the funding agencies in these austere times to open their wallets you literally have to give them evidence and the only acceptable evidence to compete with other proposals is paradoxically to do almost the exact study needed funding that is you have to do of the study before you even get funding as a scientist at a national lab i m very aware of this for the smaller funded projects i m afraid that even if dr ivker and other doctors got together pooled their practice s case histories and anecdotes into a compelling picture and approach the funding agencies they would get nowhere even if they were able to publish their statistical results it is obvious from the comments by some of the doctors here is that they have decided excessive yeast colonization in the gut or sinuses leading to noticeable non lethal symptoms does not exist and is not even a tenable hypothesis so any amount of case histories or compiled anecdotal evidence to the contrary will never change their mind and not only that they would also oppose the needed studies because in their minds it s a done issue excessive yeast growth leading to diffuse allergic symptoms does not will not and cannot exist period kind of tough to dialog with those who hold such a viewpoint kind of reminds me of lister candida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in the sinuses the gi tract mouth stomach and intestines and in the vaginal tract which compete with it for food the human immune system ususally does not bother itself with these nonpathogenic organisms unless they broach the mucus membrane barrier if they do an inflammatory response will be set up most americans are not getting enough vitamin a from their diets about of all american s die with less vitamin a than they were born with u s autopsy studies while this low level of vitamin a does not cause pathology blindness it does impair the mucus membrane barrier system this would then be a predisposing factor for a strong inflammatory response after a candida bloom aren t there also other nutrients necessary to the proper working of the sinus mucus membranes and cilia while diabetics can suffer from a candida bloom the most common cause of this type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which knock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main competition for candida as far as food is concerned while drugs are available to handle candida many patients find that their doctor will not use them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection the toxicity of the anti fungal drugs does warrant some caution but if the gi or sinus inflammation is suspected to be candida and recent use of a broad spectrum antibiotic is the smoking gun then anti fungal use should be approrpriate just as the anti fungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring vaginal yeast infections in spite of what mr steve dyer says again the evidence from mycological studies indicate that many yeast fungus species can grow hyphae roots into deep tissue similar to mold growing in bread you can continue to kill the surface such as nystatin does but you can t kill that which is deeper in the tissue without using a systemic anti fungal such as itraconazole sporanox or some of the older ones such as nizoral which are more toxic and not as effective this is why as has been pointed out by recent studies sent to me by a doctor i ve been in e mail contact with thanks that nystatin is not effective in the long term treatment of gi tract candidiasis it s like trying to weed a garden by cutting off what s above the ground but leaving the roots ready to come out again once you walk away the question is whether a contained candida bloom can partially grow into tissue through the mucus membranes causing some types of symptoms in susceptible people e g allergy without becoming systemic in the classical sense of the word something in between strictly an excessive bloom not causing any problems and the full blown systemic infection that is potentially lethal in the gi system the ano rectal region seems to be a particularly good reservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very favorable environment around the rectum for transfer through moisture and humidity of candida to the vaginal tract one of the most effctive ways to minimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear also if one is an anal retentive like i ve been diagnosed in a prior post that can also provide more sites for excessive candida growth if the bloom occurs in the anal area the burning swelling pain and even blood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids if the bloom manages to move further up the gi tract very diffuse symptomatology occurs abdominal discomfort and blood in the stool this positive stool for occult blood is what sent elaine to her family doctor in the first place after extensive testing he told her that there was nothing wrong but her gut still hurt on to another doctor and so on richard kaplan has told me throiugh e mail that he considers occult blood tests in stool specimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of false positives candida blooms guys if my gut hurt me on a constant basis i would want it fixed yes it s nice to know that i don t have colon cancer but what then is causing my distress when i finally find a doctor who treats me and gets me better steve dyer calls him a quack as i ve said in private e mail there are flaws in our current medical system that make it difficult or even impossible for a physician to attempt alternative therapies after the approved proven accepted therapies don t work for example i went to three ent s who all said that i will just have to live with my acute chronic sinusitis after the ab s failed they did mention surgery to open up the ostia but my ostia weren t plugged and it would not get to the root cause of my condition after three months of aggressive and fairly non standard therapy sporanox body nutrient level monitoring and equalization vitamin c lentinen echinacea etc my health has vastly improved to where i was two years ago before my health greatly deteriorated of course skeptics would say that maybe if i did nothing i would have improved anyway but that view is stretching things quite far because of the experience of the three ent s i saw who said that i d just have to live with it i m confident i will reach what one could call a total cure the anti fungal program i undertook was one necessary step in that direction because of my overuse of ab s for the last four years note for those having sinus problems may i suggest the book by dr ivker i mention above be sure to get the revised edition i have often wondered what an m d with chronic gi distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his patients is a non existent syndrome dr ivker started off having chronic and severe sinus problems and his visits to several ent s totally floored him when they said you ll just have to live with it he spent several years trying everything standard and non standard until he was essentially cured of chronic sinusitis he now shares his approach in his book and i can honestly say that i am on the road to recovery following some parts of it his one recommendation to take a systemic anti fungal at the beginning of treatment if you have a history of anti biotic overuse has been proven to him time and time again in his own practice i m sure if i commented to him of the hard core beliefs of the anti yeast hypothesis posters that he would have definite things to say such as it s worked wonders for me in almost two thousand cases to put it mildly i also would not be surprised if he would say that they are the ones violating their moral obligations to help the patient maybe those doctors who are reading this who have a practice and are confronted by a patient having symptoms that could be due to the hypothetical yeast overgrowth e g they fit some of the profiles the pro yeast people have identified should consider anti fungal therapy if all other avenues have been exhausted remember theory and practice are two different things you cannot have one without the other they are synergistic if a doctor does something non standard yet produces noticeable symptomatic relief in over a thousand of his patients shouldn t you at least sit up and take notice maybe you ought to trust what he says and begin hypothesizing why it works instead of why it shouldn t work i m afraid a lot of doctors have become so enamored with scientific correctness that they are ignoring the patients they have sworn to help you have to do both both have to be balanced which we don t see from some of the posters to this group there comes a point when you just have to use a little common sense and maybe an empirical approach such as trying a good systemic anti fungal such as sporanox after having exhausted all the other avenues i was one of those who the traditional medical establishment was not able to help so i did the natural thing i went to a couple of doctor s who are somewhat outside this establishment and as a result i have found significant relief would it not be better if the traditional medical establishment can set up some kind of mechanism where any doctor without fear of being sued or having his license pulled can try experimental and unproven beyond a doubt therapies for his her patients that finally reach the point where all the accepted therapies are ineffective i d like to hear a doctor tell me well i ve tried all the therapies that are approved and accepted in this country and since they clearly don t work for you i now have the authority to use experimental unproven techniques that seem to have helped others i can t promise anything and there are some risks you will have to sign something saying you understand the experimental and possibly risky nature of these unproven therapies and i ll have to register your case at the state board anyway if my ent had suggested this to me i would ve jumped on this pronto instead of going to one of those doctors who for either altruistic reasons or for greed is practicing these alternative therapies with much risk to him her risk meaning losing their license and possibly to the patient such a mechanism would keep control in the more mainstream medicine and also provide valuable data that would essentially be free it also would be morally and ethically better than the current system by showing the compassion of the medical community to the patient that it s doing everything it can within reason to help the patient it is the lack of such a mechanism that is leading large numbers of people to try alternative therapies some of which seem to work like my case and others of which will never work at all true quackery i better get off my soapbox before this post reaches k in size if taken orally it can also become a major bacteria in the gut through aresol sprays it has also been used to innoculate the sinus membranes but before this innoculation occurs the mucus membrane barrier system needs to be strengthened this is accomplished by vitamin a vitamin c and some of the b complex vitamins diet surveys repeatedly show that americans are not getting enough b and folate these are probably the segement of the population that will have the greatest problem with this non existent disorder candida blooms after antibiotic therapy what dosage of b appears to be necessary to promote the healing and proper working of the mucos memebranes some of the above material was obtained from natural healing by mark bricklin published by rodale press as well as notes from my human nutrition course i will be posting a discussion of vitamin a sometime in the future along with reference citings to point out the extremely important role that vitamin a plays in the mucus membrane defense system in the body and why vitamin a should be effective in dealing with candida blooms another effective dietary treatment is to restrict carbohydrate intake during the treatment phase this is especially important if the gi system is involved if candida can not get glucose it s not going to out grow the bacteria and you then give bacteria which can use amino acids and fatty acids for energy a chance to take over and keep the candida in check once carbohydrate is returned to the gut i d like to see the role of complex carbohydrates such as starch if steve and some of the other nay sayers want to jump all over this post fine i jumped all over steve in sci med nutrition because he verbably accosted a poster who was seeking advice about her doctor s use of vitamin a and anti fungals for a candida bloom in her gut people seeking advice from newsnet should not be treated this way those of us giving of our time and knowledge can slug it out to our heart s content if you saved your venom for me steve and left the helpless posters who are timidly seeking help alone i wouldn t have a problem with your behavior brave soul you are the venom on usenet can be quite toxic unless one develops an immunity

sci.med	how to prevent kidney stone formation i got asked in sci med nutrition about vitamin c and oxalate production toxic kidney stone formation i decided to post my answer here as well because of the recent question about kidney stones not long after i got into sci med i got flamed by a medical fellow for stating that magnesium would prevent kidney stone formation i m going to state it again here but the best way to prevent kidney stones from forming is to take b supplements read on to find out why i have my asbestos suit on now guys vitamin c will form oxalic acid but large doses are needed above grams per day review article nutritional factors in calcium containing kidney stones with particular emphasis on vitamin c int clin nutr rev but glycine also forms oxalic acid d amino acid oxidases for both glycine and vitamin c one of the best ways to drastically reduce this production is not to cut back on dietary intake of vitamin c or glycine but to increase your intake of vitamin b control of hyperoxaluria with large doses of pyridoxine in patients with kidney stones int urol nephrol to mg of b each day significasntly decreased the urinary excretion of oxalate over the month treatment program the action of pyridoxine in primary hyperoxaluria clin sci patients receiving at least mg b each day showed a significant reduction in urinary oxalate levels for gylcine this effect is due to increased transaminase activity b is required for transaminase activity which makes less glycine available for oxidative deamination d amino acid oxidases for vitamin c the effect is quite different there are different pathways for vitamin c catabolism the pathway that leads to oxalic acid formation will usually have to of the ingested dose going into oxalic acid but this is highly variable and the vitamin c review article pointed out that unless the dose gets upto grams per day not too much vitamin c gets catabolized to form oxalic acid at very high doses of vitamin c above grams per day more of the extra vitamin c more than conversion can end up as oxalic acid in a very early study on vitamin c and oxalic production proc soc exp biol med intakes of grams per day up to grams per day increased the average oxalic acid excretion from mg per day up to mg per day until grams per day was reached the average excreted was increased by only to mg per day gram dose gram dose gram dose and gram dose grams jumped it to mg over the average excretion before supplementation and grams jumped it to mg over the average before supplementation b is required by more enzymes than any other vitamin in the body there are probably some enzymes that require vitamin b that we don t know about yet vitamin c catabolism is still not completely understood but the speculation is that this other pathway that does not form oxalic acid must have an enzyme in it that requires b differences in b levels could then explain the very variable production of oxalic acid from a vitamin c challenge this is not the preferred route of catabolism increasing your intake of b would then result in less oxalic acid being formmed if you take vitamin c supplements since the typical american diet is deficient in b some researchers believe that the main cause of calcium oxalate kidney stones is b deficiency especially since so little oxalic acid gets absorbed from the gut diets providing to mg of oxalic acid per day showed absolutely no change in urinary excretion of oxalate urol int if mg was present each day there was a significant increase in urinary oxalate excretion here are the high oxalate foods beans coca instant coffee parsley rhubarb spinach and tea contain at least mg grams beet tops carrots celery chocolate cumber grapefruit kale peanuts pepper sweet potatoe contain to mg grams if the threshold is mg per day you can see that you really have a lot of latitude in food selection a recent n eng j med article also points out that one good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to increase your intake of calcium which will prevent most of the dietary oxalate from being absorbed at all if you also increase your intake of b you shouldn t have to worry about kidney stones at all the rda for b is mg per day for males and mg per day for females directly related to protein intake b can be toxic nerve damage if it is consumed in doses of mg or more per day for an extended peroid weeks to months the usda food survey done in had an average intake of mg per day for males and mg per day for females living in the u s coupled with this low intake was a high protein diet which greatly increases the b requirement as well as the presence of some of the different drugs that either block b absorption are metabolic antagonists of b or promote b excretion in the urine common ones are birth control pills alcohol isoniazid penicillamine and corticosteroids i tell my students to supplement all their patients that are going to get any of the drugs that increase the b requirement the dose recommended for patients taking birth control pills is mg per day and this should work for most of the other drugs that increase the b requirement this would be on top of your dietary intake of b any patient that has a history of kidney stone formation should be given b supplements one other good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to make sure your ca mg dietary ratio is magnesium oxalate is much more soluble than is calcium oxalate the magnesium calcium ratio in the concentrated urines of patients with calcium oxalate calculi invest urol effect of magnesium citrate and magnesium oxide on the crystallization of calcium in urine changes producted by food magnesium interaction j urol review article magnesium in the physiopathology and treatment of renal calcium stones j presse med there are actually about three times as many articles published in the medical literature on the role of magnesium in preventing kidney stone formation than there are for b i thought that i was being pretty safe in stating that magnesium would prevent kidney stone formation in an earlier post in this news group but good old john a in mass jumped all over me i guess that he doesn t read the medical literature oh well since kidney stones can be a real pain and a lot of people suffer from them i thought i d tell you how you can avoid the pain and stay out of the doctor

this topic sparked by attempts to block the galileo and ulysses launches on grounds of the plutonium thermal sources being dangerous numerous studies claim that even in worst case scenarios shuttle explosion during launch or accidental reentry at interplanetary velocities the risks are extremely small two interesting data points are the may loss of two snap b rtgs which landed intact in the pacific ocean after a nimbus b weather satellite failed to reach orbit the fuel was recovered after months with no release of plutonium in april the apollo lunar module reentered the atmosphere and its snap rtg heat source which was jettisoned fell intact into the feet deep tonga trench in the pacific ocean the corrosion resistant materials of the rtg are expected to prevent release of the fuel

made that chemicals released from the space shuttle s solid rocket boosters srbs are responsible for a significant amount of damage to the ozone layer studies indicate that they in reality have only a minute impact both in absolute terms and relative to other chemical sources the remainder of this item is a response from the author of the quoted study charles jackman the atmospheric modelling study of the space shuttle effects on the stratosphere involved three independent theoretical groups and was organized by dr michael prather nasa goddard institute for space studies the three groups involved michael prather and maria garcia nasa giss charlie jackman and anne douglass nasa goddard space flight center and malcolm ko and dak sze atmospheric and environmental research inc the effort was to look at the effects of the space shuttle and titan rockets on the stratosphere the following are the estimated sources of stratospheric chlorine industrial sources kilograms year natural sources kilograms year shuttle sources kilograms year the shuttle source assumes space shuttles and titan rockets are launched yearly thus the launches would add less than to the total stratospheric chlorine sources the effect on ozone is minimal global yearly average total ozone would be decreased by this is much less than total ozone variability associated with volcanic activity and solar flares the influence of human made chlorine products on ozone is computed by atmospheric model calculations to be a decrease in globally averaged ozone between and the influence of the space shuttle and titan rockets on the stratosphere is negligible the launch schedule of the space shuttle and titan rockets would need to be increased by over a factor of a hundred in order to have about the same effect on ozone as our increases in industrial halocarbons do at the present time theoretical results of this study have been published in the space shuttle s impact on the stratosphere mj prather mm

eds report sam tr june usaf school of aerospace medicine brooks afb texas how the challenger astronauts died the challenger shuttle launch was not destroyed in an explosion this is a well documented fact see the rogers commission report for example what looked like an explosion was fuel burning after the external tank came apart the forces on the crew cabin were not sufficient to kill the astronauts never mind destroy their bodies according to the kerwin team s medical forensic report the astronauts were killed when the more or less intact cabin hit the water at circa mph and their bodies then spent several weeks underwater their remains were recovered and after the kerwin team examined them they were sent off to be buried using the shuttle beyond low earth orbit you can t use the shuttle orbiter for missions beyond low earth orbit because it can t get there it is big and heavy and does not carry enough fuel even if you fill part of the cargo bay with tanks furthermore it is not particularly sensible to do so because much of that weight is things like wings which are totally useless except in the immediate vicinity of the earth the shuttle orbiter is highly specialized for travel between earth s surface and low orbit taking it higher is enormously costly and wasteful a much better approach would be to use shuttle subsystems to build a specialized high orbit spacecraft yet another concise answer by henry spencer the face on mars there really is a big rock on mars that looks remarkably like a humanoid face it appears in two different frames of viking

has championed the idea that the face is artificial intended to resemble a human and erected by an extraterrestrial civilization most other analysts concede that the resemblance is most likely accidental other viking images show a smiley faced crater and a lava flow resembling kermit the frog elsewhere on mars there exists a mars anomalies research society sorry don t know the address to

announcement q how do i become an astronaut a we will assume you mean a nasa astronaut since it s probably impossible for a non russian to get into the cosmonaut corps paying passengers are not professional cosmonauts and the other nations have so few astronauts and fly even fewer that you re better off hoping to win a lottery becoming a shuttle pilot requires lots of fast jet experience which means a military flying career forget that unless you want to do it anyway so you want to become a shuttle mission specialist if you aren t a us citizen become one that is a must after that the crucial thing to remember is that the demand for such jobs vastly exceeds the supply nasa s problem is not finding qualified people but thinning the lineup down to manageable length it is not enough to be qualified you must avoid being dis qualified for any reason many of them in principle quite irrelevant to the job get a ph d specialize in something that involves getting your hands dirty with equipment not just paper and pencil forget computer programming entirely it will be done from the ground for the fore seeable future degree s in one field plus work experience in another seems to be a frequent winner be in good physical condition with good eyesight do not get a radial keratomy or similar hack to improve your vision nobody knows what sudden pressure changes would do to rked eyes and long term effects are poorly understood for that matter avoid any other significant medical unknowns if you can pass a jet pilot physical you should be okay if you can t your chances are poor practise public speaking and be conservative and conformist in appearance and actions you ve got a tough selling job ahead trying to convince a cautious conservative selection committee that you are better than hundreds of other applicants and also that you will be a credit to nasa after you are hired public relations is a significant part of the job and nasa s image is very prim and proper the image you want is squeaky clean workaholic yuppie remember also that you will need a security clearance at some point and security considers everybody guilty until proven innocent keep your nose clean get a pilot s license and make flying your number one hobby experienced pilots are known to be favored even for non pilot jobs work for nasa of astronauts selected between and were military or nasa employees and the remaining two were a nasa consultant and mae jemison the first black female astronaut if you apply from outside nasa and miss but they offer you a job at nasa take it sometimes in the past this has meant you do look interesting but we want to know you a bit better first think space they want highly motivated people so lose no chance to demonstrate motivation keep trying many astronauts didn t make it the first time nasa national aeronautics and space administration lyndon b johnson space center houston texas announcement for mission specialist and pilot astronaut candidates astronaut candidate program the national aeronautics and space administration nasa has a need for pilot astronaut candidates and mission specialist astronaut candidates to support the space shuttle program nasa is now accepting on a continuous basis and plans to select astronaut candidates as needed persons from both the civilian sector and the military services will be considered all positions are located at the lyndon b johnson space center in houston texas and will involved a year training and evaluation program space shuttle program description the numerous successful flights of the space shuttle have demonstrated that operation and experimental investigations in space are becoming routine the space shuttle orbiter is launched into and maneuvers in the earth orbit performing missions lastling up to days it then returns to earth and is ready for another flight with payloads and flight crew the orbiter performs a variety of orbital missions including deployment and retrieval of satellites service of existing satellites operation of specialized laboratories astronomy earth sciences materials processing manufacturing and other operations these missions will eventually include the development and servicing of a permanent space station the orbiter also provides a staging capability for using higher orbits than can be achieved by the orbiter itself users of the space shuttle s capabilities are both domestic and foreign and include government agencies and private industries the crew normally consists of five people the commander the pilot and three mission specialists on occasion additional crew members are assigned the commander pilot and mission specialists are nasa astronauts pilot astronaut pilot astronauts server as both space shuttle commanders and pilots during flight the commander has onboard responsibility for the vehicle crew mission success and safety in flight the pilot assists the commander in controlling and operating the vehicle in addition the pilot may assist in the deployment and retrieval of satellites utilizing the remote manipulator system in extra vehicular activities and other payload operations mission specialist astronaut mission specialist astronauts working with the commander and pilot have overall responsibility for the coordination of shuttle operations in the areas of crew activity planning consumables usage and experiment and payload operations mission specialists are required to have a detailed knowledge of shuttle systems as well as detailed knowledge of the operational characteristics mission requirements and objectives and supporting systems and equipment for each of the experiments to be conducted on their assigned missions mission specialists will perform extra vehicular activities payload handling using the remote manipulator system and perform or assist in specific experimental operations astronaut candidate program basic qualification requirements applicants must meet the following minimum requirements prior to submitting an application mission specialist astronaut candidate bachelor s degree from an accredited institution in engineering

requirements applications for the astronaut candidate program must be citizens of the united states note on academic requirements applicants for the astronaut candidate program must meet the basic education requirements for nasa engineering and scientific positions specifically successful completion of standard professional curriculum in an accredited college or university leading to at least a bachelor s degree with major study in an appropriate field of engineering biological science physical science or mathematics the following degree fields while related to engineering and the sciences are not considered qualifying degrees in technology engineering technology aviation technology medical technology etc degrees in psychology except for clinical psychology physiological psychology or experimental psychology which are qualifying degrees in nursing degrees in social sciences geography anthropology archaeology etc degrees in aviation aviation management or similar fields application procedures civilian the application package may be obtained by writing to nasa johnson space center astronaut selection office attn ahx houston tx civilian applications will be accepted on a continuous basis when nasa decides to select additional astronaut candidates consideration will be given only to those applications on hand on the date of decision is made applications received after that date will be retained and considered for the next selection applicants will be notified annually of the opportunity to update their applications and to indicate continued interest in being considered for the program those applicants who do not update their applications annually will be dropped from consideration and their applications will not be retained after the preliminary screening of applications additional information may be requested for some applicants and person listed on the application as supervisors and references may be contacted active duty military active duty military personnel must submit applications to their respective military service and not directly to nasa application procedures will be disseminated by each service selection personal interviews and thorough medical evaluations will be required for both civilian and military applicants under final consideration once final selections have been made all applicants who were considered will be notified of the outcome of the process selection rosters established through this process may be used for the selection of additional candidates during a one year period following their establishment general program requirements selected applicants will be designated astronaut candidates and will be assigned to the astronaut office at the johnson space center houston texas the astronaut candidates will undergo a year training and evaluation period during which time they will be assigned technical or scientific responsibilities allowing them to contribute substantially to ongoing programs they will also participate in the basic astronaut training program which is designed to develop the knowledge and skills required for formal mission training upon selection for a flight pilot astronaut candidates will maintain proficiency in nasa aircraft during their candidate period applicants should be aware that selection as an astronaut candidate does not insure selection as an astronaut final selection as an astronaut will depend on satisfactory completion of the year training and evaluation period civilian candidates who successfully complete the training and evaluation and are selected as astronauts will become permanent federal employees and will be expected to remain with nasa for a period of at least five years civilian candidates who are not selected as astronauts may be placed in other positions within nasa depending upon agency requirements and manpower constraints at that time successful military candidates will be detailed to nasa for a specified tour of duty nasa has an affirmative action program goal of having qualified minorities and women among those qualified as astronaut candidates therefore qualified minorities and women are encouraged to apply pay and benefits civilians salaries for civilian astronaut candidates are based on the federal governments general schedule pay scales for grades gs through gs and are set in accordance with each individuals academic achievements and experience other benefits include vacation and sick leave a retirement plan and participation in group health and life insurance plans military selected military personnel will be

sci.space	space faq introduction archive name space intro last modified date frequently asked questions on sci space sci astro introduction this series of linked messages is periodically posted to the usenet groups sci space and sci astro in an attempt to provide good answers to frequently asked questions and other reference material which is worth preserving if you have corrections or answers to other frequently asked questions that you would like included in this posting send email to leech cs unc edu jon leech if you don t want to see the faq add frequently asked questions to your kill file for this group if you re not reading this with a newsreader that can kill articles by subject you re out of luck the faq volume is excessive right now and will hopefully be trimmed down by rewriting and condensing over time the faq postings are available in the ames space archive in faq faq good summaries will be accepted in place of the answers given here the point of this is to circulate existing information and avoid rehashing old answers better to build on top than start again nothing more depressing than rehashing old topics for the th time references are provided because they give more complete information than any short generalization questions fall into three basic types where do i find some information about space try your local public library first the net is not a good place to ask for general information ask individuals by email if you must there are other sources use them too the net is a place for open ended discussion i have an idea which would improve space flight hope you aren t surprised but out of have usually been thought of before again contact a direct individual source for evaluation nasa fields thousands of these each day miscellanous queries

sci.space	space faq network resources archive name space net last modified date network resources overview you may be reading this document on any one of an amazing variety of computers so much of the material below may not apply to you in general however systems connected to the net fall in one of three categories internet usenet or bitnet electronic mail may be sent between these networks and other resources available on one of these networks are sometimes accessible from other networks by email sent to special servers the space and astronomy discussion groups actually are composed of several mechanisms with mostly transparent connections between them one mechanism is the mailing list in which mail is sent to a central distribution point which relays it to all recipients of the list in addition to the general lists for space called space digest for internet users and space on bitnet there are a number of more specialized mailing lists described below a second mechanism is usenet netnews this is somewhat like a bulletin board operating on each system which is a part of the net netnews separates contributions into hundreds of different categories based on a group name the groups dealing most closely with space topics are called sci space news sci space sci space shuttle sci astro and talk politics space contributors post submissions called articles in netnews terminology on their local machine which sends it to other nearby machines similarly articles sent from nearby machines are stored locally and may be forwarded to other systems so that an article is posted locally and eventually reaches all the usenet sites interested in receiving the news group to which the article was posted gateway machines redirect the usenet sci space group into internet and bitnet mailing lists and vice versa the other usenet groups are not accessible as mailing lists if you can receive netnews its more flexible interface and access to a wider range of material usually make it the preferred option mailing lists space digest is the main internet list and is now being run by the international space university in only its second change of management in over a decade

does the shuttle roll just after liftoff the following answer and translation are provided by ken jenks kjenks gothamcity jsc nasa gov the ascent guidance and flight control training manual asc g c says during the vertical rise phase the launch pad attitude is commanded until an i loaded v rel sufficient to assure launch tower clearance is achieved then the tilt maneuver roll program orients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a negative q alpha which in turn alleviates structural loading other advantages with this attitude are performance gain decreased abort maneuver complexity improved s band look angles and crew view of the horizon the tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining downrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff meco target in second stage this really is a good answer but it s couched in nasa jargon i ll try to interpret we wait until the shuttle clears the tower before rolling then we roll the shuttle around so that the angle of attack between the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere the relative wind and the chord of the wings the imaginary line between the leading edge and the trailing edge is a slightly negative angle a negative q alpha this causes a little bit of downward force toward the belly of the orbiter or the z direction and this force alleviates structural loading we have to be careful about those wings they re about the most delicate part of the vehicle the new attitude after the roll also allows us to carry more mass to orbit or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass or to change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be the case if we didn t roll performance gain the new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated flight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort maneuvers the return to launch site decreased abort maneuver complexity the new attitude improves the ability for ground based radio antennae to have a good line of sight signal with the s band radio antennae on the orbiter improved s band look angles the new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon which is a helpful but not mandatory part of piloting any flying machine the new attitude orients the shuttle so that the body is more nearly parallel with the ground and the nose to the east usually this allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity in the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit remember velocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction the shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its velocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit this all begs the question why isn t the launch pad oriented to give this nice attitude to begin with why does the shuttle need to roll to achieve that attitude the answer is that the pads were leftovers from the apollo days the shuttle straddles two flame trenches one for the solid rocket motor exhaust one for the space shuttle main engine exhaust you can see the effects of this on any daytime launch the srm exhaust is dirty gray garbage and the ssme exhaust is fluffy white steam watch for the difference between the top orbiter side and the bottom external tank side of the stack the access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented basically the same way they were for the saturn v s a side note the saturn v s also had a roll program don t ask me why i m a shuttle guy i checked with a buddy in ascent dynamics he added that the roll maneuver is really a maneuver in all three axes roll pitch and yaw the roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons stated the pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping the angle of attack q alpha within a tight tolerance the yaw component is used to determine the orbital inclination the total maneuver is really expressed as a quaternion a grad level math concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four element array how to receive the nasa tv

launch in the guidance instructions from the ground stopped reaching the rocket due to a problem with its antenna so the onboard computer took control however there turned out to be a bug in the guidance software and the rocket promptly went off course so the range safety officer destroyed it although the bug is sometimes claimed to have been an incorrect fortran do statement it was actually a transcription error in which the bar indicating smoothing was omitted from the expression r dot bar sub n nth smoothed value of derivative of radius this error led the software to treat normal minor variations of velocity as if they were serious leading to incorrect compensation mariner became the first successful probe to flyby venus in december of and it returned information which confirmed that venus is a very hot degrees fahrenheit now revised to degrees f world with a cloud covered atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide sulfuric acid was later confirmed in mariner launched on november was lost when its protective shroud failed to eject as the craft was placed into interplanetary space unable to collect the sun s energy for power from its solar panels the probe soon died when its batteries ran out and is now in solar orbit it was intended for a mars flyby with mariner mariner the sister probe to mariner did reach mars in and took the first close up images of the martian surface in all as it flew by the planet the probe found a cratered world with an atmosphere much thinner than previously thought many scientists concluded from this preliminary scan that mars was a dead world in both the geological and biological sense mariner was sent to venus in it reconfirmed the data on that planet collected five years earlier by mariner plus the information that venus atmospheric pressure at its surface is at least times that of earth s or the equivalent of being feet under the surface of an ocean mariner and were sent to mars in and expanded upon the work done by mariner four years earlier however they failed to take away the concept of mars as a dead planet first made from the basic measurements of mariner mariner ended up in the atlantic ocean in when the rocket launcher autopilot failed mariner the sister probe to mariner became the first craft to orbit mars in it returned information on the red planet that no other probe had done before revealing huge volcanoes on the martian surface as well as giant canyon systems and evidence that water once flowed across the planet the probe also took the first detailed closeup images of mars two small moons phobos and deimos mariner used venus as a gravity assist to mercury in the probe did return the first close up images of the venusian atmosphere in ultraviolet revealing previously unseen details in the cloud cover plus the fact that the entire cloud system circles the planet in four earth days mariner eventually made three flybys of mercury from to before running out of attitude control gas the probe revealed mercury as a heavily cratered world with a mass much greater than thought this would seem to indicate that mercury has an iron core which makes up percent of the entire planet pioneer moon sun venus jupiter and saturn flybys and orbiters pioneer through failed to meet their main objective to photograph the moon close up but they did reach far enough into space to provide new information on the area between earth and the moon including new data on the van allen radiation belts circling earth all three craft had failures with their rocket launchers pioneer was launched on october pioneer on november and pioneer on december pioneer was a moon probe which missed the moon and became the first u s spacecraft to orbit the sun in pioneer was originally designed to flyby venus but the mission was scaled down and it instead studied the interplanetary environment between venus and earth out to million kilometers in a record until mariner pioneer through were placed into solar orbit from to pioneer and are still transmitting information at this time pioneer e would have been number suffered a launch failure in pioneer became the first spacecraft to flyby jupiter in pioneer followed it in and then went on to become the first probe to study saturn in both vehicles should continue to function through and are heading off into interstellar space the first craft ever to do so pioneer venus also known as pioneer venus orbiter or pioneer burned up in the venusian atmosphere on october pvo made the first radar studies of the planet s surface via probe pioneer venus also known as pioneer sent four small probes into the atmosphere in december of the main spacecraft bus burned up high in the atmosphere while the four probes descended by parachute towards the surface though none were expected to survive to the surface the day probe did make it and transmitted for minutes on the ground before its batteries failed ranger lunar lander and impact missions ranger and were test probes for the ranger lunar impact series they were meant for high earth orbit testing in but rocket problems left them in useless low orbits which quickly decayed ranger launched on january was intended to land an instrument capsule on the surface of the moon but problems during the launch caused the probe to miss the moon and head into solar orbit ranger did try to take some images of the moon as it flew by but the camera was unfortunately aimed at deep space during the attempt ranger launched april had the same purpose as ranger but suffered technical problems enroute and crashed on the lunar farside the first u s probe to reach the moon albeit without returning data ranger launched october and similar to ranger and lost all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually missed the moon and drifted off into solar orbit ranger through had more modified lunar missions they were to send back live images of the lunar surface as they headed towards an impact with the moon ranger failed this objective in when its cameras did not operate ranger through performed well becoming the first u s lunar probes to return thousands of lunar images through lunar orbiter lunar surface photography lunar orbiter through were designed to orbit the moon and image various sites being studied as landing areas for the manned apollo missions of the probes also contributed greatly to our understanding of lunar surface features particularly the lunar farside all five probes of the series launched from to were essentially successful in their missions they were the first u s probes to orbit the moon all los were eventually crashed into the lunar surface to avoid interference with the manned apollo missions surveyor lunar soft landers the surveyor series were designed primarily to see if an apollo lunar module could land on the surface of the moon without sinking into the soil before this time it was feared by some that the moon was covered in great layers of dust which would not support a heavy landing vehicle surveyor was successful in proving that the lunar surface was strong enough to hold up a spacecraft from to only surveyor and were unsuccessful missions the rest became the first u s probes to soft land on the moon taking thousands of images and scooping the soil for analysis apollo landed feet from surveyor in and returned parts of the craft to earth surveyor the last of the series was a purely scientific mission which explored the tycho crater region in viking mars orbiters and landers viking was launched from cape canaveral florida on august on a titan e centaur d rocket the probe went into martian orbit on june and the lander set down on the western slopes of chryse planitia on july it soon began its programmed search for martian micro organisms there is still debate as to whether the probes found life there or not and sent back incredible color panoramas of its surroundings one thing scientists learned was that mars sky was pinkish in color not dark blue as they originally thought the sky is pink due to sunlight reflecting off the reddish dust particles in the thin atmosphere the lander set down among a field of red sand and boulders stretching out as far as its cameras could image the viking orbiter kept functioning until august when it ran out of attitude control propellant the lander was switched into a weather reporting mode where it had been hoped it would keep functioning through but after november an errant command had been sent to the lander accidentally telling it to shut down until further orders communication was never regained again despite the engineers efforts through may of an interesting side note viking s lander has been designated the thomas a mutch memorial station in honor of the late leader of the lander imaging team the national air and space museum in washington d c is entrusted with the safekeeping of the mutch station plaque until it can be attached to the lander by a manned expedition viking was launched on september and arrived in martian orbit on august the lander touched down on september in utopia planitia it accomplished essentially the same tasks as its sister lander with the exception that its seisometer worked recording one marsquake the orbiter had a series of attitude control gas leaks in which prompted it being shut down that july the lander was shut down on april the orbits of both viking orbiters should decay around voyager outer planet flybys voyager was launched september and flew past jupiter on march and by saturn on november voyager was launched august before voyager and flew by jupiter on august by saturn on august by uranus on january and by neptune on august voyager took advantage of a rare once every years alignment to slingshot its way from outer planet to outer planet voyager could in principle have headed towards pluto but jpl opted for the sure thing of a titan close up between the two probes our knowledge of the giant planets their satellites and their rings has become immense voyager discovered that jupiter has complicated atmospheric dynamics lightning and aurorae three new satellites were discovered two of the major surprises were that jupiter has rings and that io has active sulfurous volcanoes with major effects on the jovian magnetosphere when the two probes reached saturn they discovered over ringlets and satellites including the predicted shepherd satellites that keep the rings stable the weather was tame compared with jupiter massive jet streams with minimal variance a year great white spot band cycle is known titan s atmosphere was smoggy mimas appearance was startling one massive impact crater gave it the death star appearance the big surprise here was the stranger aspects of the rings braids kinks and spokes were both unexpected and difficult to explain voyager thanks to heroic engineering and programming efforts continued the mission to uranus and neptune uranus itself was highly monochromatic in appearance one oddity was that its magnetic axis was found to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational axis giving uranus a peculiar magnetosphere icy channels were found on ariel and miranda was a bizarre patchwork of different terrains satellites and one more ring were discovered in contrast to uranus neptune was found to have rather active weather including numerous cloud features the ring arcs turned out to be bright patches on one ring two other rings and other satellites were discovered neptune s magnetic axis was also skewed triton had a canteloupe appearance and geysers what s liquid at k the two voyagers are expected to last for about two more decades their on target journeying gives negative evidence about possible planets

to be seen japanese planetary missions sakigake ms t was launched from the kagoshima space center by isas on january and approached halley s comet within about million km on march the spacecraft is carrying three instru ments to measure interplanetary magnetic field plasma waves solar wind all of which work normally now so isas made an earth swingby by sakigake on january into an orbit similar to the earth s the closest approach was at h m s jst utc h on january the geocentric distance was km this is the first planet swingby for a japanese spacecraft during the approach sakigake observed the geotail some geotail passages will be scheduled in some years hence the second earth swingby will be on june at re earth s radius and the third october at re hiten a small lunar probe was launched into earth orbit on january the spacecraft was then known as muses a but was renamed to hiten once in orbit the lb probe looped out from earth and made its first lunary flyby on march where it dropped off its lb midget satellite hagoromo japan at this point became the third nation to orbit a satellite around the moon joining the unites states and ussr the smaller spacecraft hagoromo remained in orbit around the moon an apparently broken transistor radio caused the japanese space scientists to lose track of it hagoromo s rocket motor fired on schedule on march but the spacecraft s tracking transmitter failed immediately the rocket firing of hagoromo was optically confirmed using the schmidt camera cm f at the kiso observatory in japan hiten made multiple lunar flybys at approximately monthly intervals and performed aerobraking experiments using the earth s atmosphere hiten made a close approach to the moon at jst utc h on february at the height of km from the moon s surface n e

on particular space missions and periodical sources on space probes this list is by no means complete it is primarily designed to give you places to start your research through generally available works on the subject if anyone can add pertinent works to the list it would be greatly appreciated though naturally i recommend all the books listed below i think it would be best if you started out with the general overview books in order to give you a clear idea of the history of space exploration in this area i also recommend that you pick up some good up to date general works on astronomy and the sol system to give you some extra background most of these books and periodicals can be found in any good public and university library some of the more recently published works can also be

missions to mercury venus and mars the viking probes to mars and the voyager missions to jupiter saturn uranus and neptune more details on american soviet european and japanese probe missions can be found in sky and telescope astronomy science nature and scientific american magazines time newsweek and various major newspapers can supply not only general information on certain missions but also show you what else was going on with earth at the time events were unfolding if that is of interest to you space missions are affected by numerous political economic and climatic factors as you probably know depending on just how far your interest in space probes will go you might also wish to join the planetary society one of the largest space groups in the world dedicated to planetary exploration their periodical the planetary report details the latest space probe missions write to the planetary society north catalina avenue pasadena california usa good luck with your studies in

orbit on equipped with large area wide wavelength angstrom x ray telescope x ray ccd cameras and imaging gas scintillation proportional counters cassini saturn orbiter and titan atmosphere probe cassini is a joint nasa esa project designed to accomplish an exploration of the saturnian system with its cassini saturn orbiter and huygens titan probe cassini is scheduled for launch aboard a titan iv centaur in october of after gravity assists of venus earth and jupiter in a vvejga trajectory the spacecraft will arrive at saturn in june of upon arrival the cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an orbit around saturn near the end of this initial orbit the huygens probe separates from the orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of titan the orbiter relays the probe data to earth for about hours while the probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the surface after the completion of the probe mission the orbiter continues touring the saturnian system for three and a half years titan synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about flybys of titan and targeted flybys of iapetus dione and enceladus the objectives of the mission are threefold conduct detailed studies of saturn s atmosphere rings and magnetosphere conduct close up studies of saturn s satellites and characterize titan s atmosphere and surface one of the most intriguing aspects of titan is the possibility that its surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere these hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain down onto the surface the cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to peer through titan s clouds and determine if there is liquid on the surface experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere the cassini mission is named for jean dominique cassini the first director of the paris observatory who discovered several of saturn s satellites and the major division in its rings the titan atmospheric entry probe is named for the dutch physicist christiaan huygens who discovered titan and first described the true nature of saturn s rings key scheduled dates for the cassini mission vvejga trajectory titan iv centaur launch venus gravity assist venus gravity assist

sci.space	nasa wraps in the april edition of one small step for a space activist allen sherzer tim kyger write another problem is what are called wraps or sometimes the center tax when work for a large program like freedom or shuttle is performed at a nasa center the center skims off a portion which goes into what amounts to a slush fund this money is used to fund work the center manager wants to fund this sum is estimated to be over a third of the funds allocated think about that of the billion cost of freedom fully billion won t be spent on anything having anything to do with space stations now maybe that billion was wisely spent and maybe it wasn t but the work done with it should stand on its own merits not distorting the cost of other projects congress has no idea of the existense of these wraps congress has never heard the term center tax they look at the station they are getting and the price they are paying and note that it doesn t add up they wonder this blissfully unaware that a third of the money is going for something else my dear friends your mixing fact and fiction here a couple of weeks ago when i first read this in your posting i talked with one of the cost experts here in space station at headquarters if you wondering why i didn t post a response immediately i do have a real job i m supposed to be doing here at headquarters digging up old khz data looking into sherzer kyger claims rates pretty low on the totem pole of priority also i spent last weekend in kansas city at the national science teachers association conference extolling the virtues of ssf to science teachers first off yes the concept of center tax or wrap does exist if i recall the numbers correctly the total tax for the ssf program for this fiscal year is around million this was computed by adding up the wp wp and wp center taxes with the ssf budget for this fiscal year at billion my calculater says the tax percentage is over the life of the ssf program using your figure of billion for the cost of ssf a tax at a rate comes to million this is alot less than billion but i will concede it s still an appreciable amount of pocket change i should note that your estimate of the tax rate at could be close to the actual rate the tax is only charged on funds that are spent at the center kind of like mcdonalds at some states where you do have to pay sales tax if you eat the food at the restaurant but you don t if you get it take out for example at wp the vast bulk of the funds we receive go to the rocketdyne contract and are not subject to the center tax i don t have the numbers in front of me but i d guess at least of the wp funds go to rocketdyne so you could be right about a tax rate of but it s only applied to funds spent at the center and not to the prime contracts this leads to the obvious question what is the government doing with ssf funds that don t go to the prime contractors i e ok wp gets a slice of the billion pie a big portion of this slice goes to rocketdyne what happens to the balance of the funds which aren t eaten up by the center tax at wp we call these funds we spend in house supporting development funds as they are supporting the development work done by rocketdyne we have used these funds to setup our own testbed to checkout the electrical power system architecture our testbed has a real life solar array field left over from solar cell research research a few years back with lead acid car batteries to simulate the nickel hydrogen batteries on ssf dc switchgear dc dc converter units and simulated loads data from the testbed was used in a recent change evaluation involving concerns about the stability of the power system we have also used the supporting development money to purchase nickel hydrogen batteries which are on life testing at both lewis and the crane naval facility in indiana as a side point of the battery cells on test recently hit the four year life test milestone cells have completed to cycles the on orbit batteries go through cycles per year as a final example my home division at lewis used the supporting development funds to purchase personal computers and work stations for performing system analyses like modeling of the performance of the electrical power system availability calculations using a monte carlo simulation setting up a database with information on weight of the power system elements finally the money raised by the tax does not all go into a slush fund at lewis the director does control a small discretionary fund each year any individual at lewis can submit a proposal to the director to get money from this fund to look at pretty much anything within the lewis charter most of the tax however goes to fund the general services at the center like the library the central computer services division the contractor who removes the snow etc thus it is rather difficult to determine what percentage of the ssf budget doesn t go for ssf activities to get an accurate figure you would have to take the annual expenditure for the library for example and then divide by the amount of the library funds used to support ssf which would be hard to compute by itself how would you figure out what percentage of the bill for aviation week for year is billable to ssf would you base it on the person hours ssf employees spend reading av week versus the rest of the center personnel you would then have to compare this estimate of the ssf portion of the library expense with the portion of the tax that goes to support the library who knows maybe ssf overpays on the tax to run the library but we underpay for snow removal talk about a burecratic nightmare my last point is that i can t believe your claim that congress has never heard of the term center tax unfortunately all of the nasa testimony before congress isn t on a computer so i can t do a simple word search someplace to prove you wrong but surely in some gao audit somewhere these nasa cost methods were documented for congress
sci.space	dc x rollout report mcdonnell douglas rolls out dc x huntington beach calif on a picture perfect southern california day mcdonnell douglas rolled out its dc x rocket ship last saturday the company hopes this single stage rocket technology demonstrator will be the first step towards a single stage to orbit ssto rocket ship the white conical vehicle was scheduled to go to the white sands missile range in new mexico this week flight tests will start in mid june although there wasn t a cloud in the noonday sky the forecast for ssto research remains cloudy the sdi organization which paid million for the dc x can t itself afford to fund full development of a follow on vehicle to get the necessary hundreds of millions required for a sub orbital dc xa sdio is passing a tin cup among its sister government agencies sdio originally funded ssto research as a way to cut the costs for orbital deployments of space based sensors and weapns however recent changes in sdi s political marching orders and budget cuts have made ssto less of a priority today the agency is more interested in using dc x as a step towards a low cost reusable sounding rocket sdio has already done briefings to other government agencies said col simon pete worden sdio s deputy for technology but worden declined to say how much the agencies would have to pony up for the program i didn t make colonel by telling my contractors how much money i have available to spend he quipped at a press conference at mcdonnell douglas astronautics headquarters while sdio has lowered its sights on the program s orbital objective agency officials hail the dc x as an example of the better faster cheaper approach to hardware development the agency believes this philosophy can produce breakthroughs that leapfrog ahead of evolutionary technology developments worden said the dc x illustrates how a build a little test a little approach can produce results on time and within budget he said the program which went from concept to hardware in around months showed how today s engineers could move beyond the miracles of our parents time the key is management worden said sdio had a very light hand on this project we had only one overworked major jess sponable although the next phase may involve more agencies worden said lean management and a sense of government industry partnership will be crucial it s essential we do not end up with a large management structure where the price goes up exponentially sdio s approach also won praise from two california members of the house science space and technology committee this is the direction we re going to have to go said rep george brown the committee s democratic chairman programs that stretch aout to years aren t sustainable nasa hasn t learned it yet sdio has rep dana rohrbacher brown s republican colleague went further joking that a shrimp is a fish designed by a nasa design team rohrbacher doubted that the program ever would have been completed if it were left to the civil space agency rohrbacher whose orange county district includes mcdonnell douglas also criticized nasa air force work on conventional multi staged rockets as placing new casings around old missile technology let s not build fancy ammunition with capsules on top let s build a spaceship although rohrbacher praised sdio s sponsorship he said the private sector needs to take the lead in developing ssto technology mcdonnell douglas which faces very uncertain prospects with its c transport and space station freedom programs were more cautious about a large private secotro commitment on very large ventures companies put in seed money said charles ordahl mcdonnell douglas senior vice president for space systems you need strong government investments while the government and industry continue to differ on funding for the dc xa they agree on continuing an incremental approach to development citing corporate history they liken the process to douglas aircraft s dc aircraft just as two earlier aircraft paved the way for the dc transport a gradual evolution in single stage rocketry could eventually lead to an orbital delta clipper dc flight tests this summer at white sands will expand the envelope of performance with successive tests increasing speed and altitude the first tests will reach feet and demonstrate hovering verticle take off and landing the second series will send the unmanned dc x up to feet the third and final series will take the craft up to feet maneuvers will become more complex on third phase the final tests will include a pitch over manever that rotates the vehicle back into a bottom down configuration for a soft four legged landing the flight test series will be supervised by charles pete conrad who performed similar maneuvers on the apollo moon landing now a mcdonnell douglas vice president conrad paised the vehicles aircraft like approach to operations features include automated check out and access panels for easy maintainance if the program moves to the next stage engine technology will become a key consideration this engine would have more thrust than the pratt whitney rl a engines used on the dc x each motor uses liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants to generate up to pounds of thrust based on the engine used in centaur upper stages the a model has a thrust champer designed for sea level operation and three to on throttling capability it also is designed for repeat firings and rapid turnaround worden said future single stage rockets could employ tri propellant engine technology developed in the former soviet union the resulting engines could burn a dense hydrocarbon fuel at takeoff and then switch to liquid hydrogen at higher altitudes the mechanism for the teaming may already be in place pratt has a technology agreement with npo energomash the design bureau responsible for the tri propellant and energia cryogenic engines

should be done to some degree if you have a problem with what nick thinks should be done address it instead of just complaining about his doing so fred again you really don t get what the complaints are about do you not incredibly clear explanation of complaints something between feelings regarding nick s method and judgments about his meaning t maybe i d get it if you said what the complaints are about rather than doing the same things that you mean to complain about when you trash people how am i supposed to read that as trashing people is bad f gee funny that you get it now then deliberate obtuseness perhaps fred s issue nick s alleged trashing of others i only got it when you stopped trashing and made your point patently instead of allegorically that was my point all along fred not only do you do the same thing on the net honestly reporting your ideas on matters of policy and projects in space but your response was just baiting not even part of a debate i have yet to see nick enter into anything remotely resembling a debate i see him flame anyone or anything who disagrees with the one true szabo plan i see him attacking people calling them lazy bastard because they had the temerity to disagree with the almight nick i see him questioning peoples ethics again because they had the temerity to disagree with lord god szabo but debate bwaaaaahhhaaaa i m glad you can laugh since your ratio of debate insult is about the same not even close tommy and generally only when i m dealing with someone like nick i see we are dealing with a problem in a conflict of interpretations not least of which is your belief that only you can adequately judge what is and is not debate suffice to say that i disagree with you on that last point why don t you take a poll fred if you want some psuedo objective point of view and as usual you defend your insults with he started it yeah i took some of his research and called it my own but he started it so what if i stole his car he stole my lawnmower first besides that i think it s still open to interpretation whether nick actually did start it so your defense besides being lame and contradicting the first part of the sentence in which it occurs may not even apply anyway your defense reminds me of the guy that broke the borrowed tool i never borrowed it i already gave it back and it was broken when you gave it to me make up yer mind fred i m not convinced that people are necessary in all parts of every space based process and your response doesn t tell me a thing about the reasons why you think they should be except to impune the motives of the person with a divergent opinion who said i think they should be tommy show me a note where i said that and i ll eat this terminal see below fred fred i cocluded that you did since you took issue with it the fact that my conclusion was incorrect i e that you were taking issue with something different is evidence that your communication style is confusing or evidence that your reading and comprehension style are inadequate first i try to address what i think you meant for which i am rewarded with a denial of sorts and a smart remark then i point out that i am not clear what you did mean rather than risking your childish ire wrongly interpreting you a second time and i m stupid for it i just can t win can i fred you ve got a great point here somewhere it s just that between stupid people that you must insult and your jealous guarding of your valuable opinions you never actually get around to making it please quote the it i took issue with i believe you will see if you look that what i was and am taking issue with is mr szabo s idea that the manned program should be scrapped until such time as his toaster based infrastructure is finished all hail the szabo plan fred issue nick s alleged meaning too bad the plan only exists in your mind instead of nick s or you would have a really good point instead you have provided a good reason to ignore your insults since they are based on incorrect interpretations that you have made about others forgive me for giving your insults more meaning than they ever should have had my reading of what nick actually said is that people aren t required in all parts of all space processes so your taking issue with his opinions regarding people in the space program i read as people are required in all parts of all space processes so help me out here fred since i m so patently stupid did you read nick wrong or are you going to eat your terminal now if the latter i sure hope it s one of those cheeto and string models that all the computer mags have been raving about the point is i am not stupid because of your incorrect assumption i d only be stupid if i insulted you for having made it but alas that s your job fred and finally your style is confusing since you tried to make two points simultaneously with an allegory insult sadly one point addressed a plan that only existed in your mind and the other took issue with behaviors that you do as much as anyone more deliberate lack of understanding tommy no no i finally got it you don t like the plan that nick s posts made you imagine and you don t like nick s obnoxious behavior even though it s no worse than your own thanks for taking the time with someone as dense as myself if you have a problem with nick s delivery address that the way you bait you re perpetuating the lack of discourse that you complain of no tommy the bait is that which elicits the response nick baits i just flame him for being an obnoxious fool i don t really care who started it i read this list to get information and other s views on the issues to which it was dedicated not to be your mom he started it no he did or to hear about why nick is a very bad guy if you think flaming is bad stop flaming or at least get to the point in the first post instead of explaining yourself all the time that s nice tommy when you pay me to post to the net you can complain about not getting your money s worth perhaps if you weren t deliberately too thick to get the point the first time i wouldn t have to waste time explaining myself all the time of course socrates how could it be otherwise i think it s neat how all this criticism from you started after your fatherly admonitions to me about how such things should be handled outside usenet were somewhat rebuffed being a little hypocritical tommy to go with the immaturity or is this just the pique of a net ghod wannabe who got turned down by someone he thought was new and hence could be instructed tommy i saw you come on the net who cares who came on the net first if you do consider that you saw me come on after a brief haitus before which i was on for about years if you had seen me on the net first you d remember when nick and i went down exactly the same road regarding rude unneccesary behavior it s just amazing to me that you continue to take issue with behavior that s no worse than your own let s see here my complaints about your obnoxious behavior are hypocritical while your flames against people you decide are flamers isn t and my complaints about your name calling are immature while your name calling isn t yeah right maybe if you called me some more names i might see it better fred net ghod wannabe naturally fred you ve correctly interpreted my motivations when yours are impossible to judge from your actions as your insulting of people that try proves i didn t really care about people that fill the net with personal garbage what i really wanted was to impress everyone i only put my complaints with your behavior on private mail not because it belongs there but because i thought you were such a jerk that you d bring it back to the net playing right into my hands alas i had no idea what an intellectual master you were turning tables and bringing the history of these posts to the net for the noble and valuable purpose of embarassing me whether i should feel stupid because i tried

sci.space	end of the space age there is an interesting opinion piece in the business section of today s la times thursday april p d i thought i d post it to stir up some flame wars i mean reasoned debate let me preface it by saying that i largely agree that the space age in the romantic sense of several decades ago is over and that projects like the space station miss the point at this time reading for example what s new the weekly physics update we get here on the net it s clear that the romance of the day lies in the ever more fine grained manipulation of matter by which i include biotechnology condensed matter physics with its spinoffs in computer hardware and elsewhere and the amazing things people are doing with individual atoms these days to a large extent i think the romance some people still have with space is a matter of nostalgia i feel sure that someday we or more precisely our mind children will spread across space unless we wipe ourselves out but i think that manned space exploration is not what is exciting about what we can do now anyway let me quote some of this article but not all space age glory fades from view micheal schrage writer consultant and research associate at mit at america s space age won t have to suffer through the angst of a midlife crisis the reason is that the space age is already dead the technologies no longer define our times and the public has grown weary of the multibillion dollar celestial investments that yield minimal psychic or economic rewards space exploration has mutated from a central focuse of america s science and technology debate into a peripheral issue speace is not a meaningful part of the ongoing industrial competitiveness debate our technology infrastructure discussions or even our defense conversion policy to be sure america should continue to invest in satellite technologies for telecommunications and remote sensing cheap deep space probes would be nice too but the ideal of space as a meaningful driver of scientific and industrial innovation is now dead before the change in administrations it would have been foolish to write an obituary for the space age the bush white house aggressively supported the space program and proposed spending well over billion to build space station freedom alone even as he proposed budget cuts in other science and technology domains office of management and budget director richard darman was an outspoken public champion of big ticket space expenditures the reality that much of the civilian space program from the shuttle to the hubble telescope to the space station was poorly conceived and unimpressively implemented did not seem to matter much political inertia and a nostalgic sense of futurism not a coherent vision or cost effective sensibilities determined multibillion dollar space budgets indeed with few notable exceptions such as voyager the post apollo era is the story of the gold plated porkification of space exploration with programs and promises that delivered less for more and more while the clinton administration has kept on the highly regarded daniel goldin as administrator of the national aeronautics and space administration it seems clear that space exploration is not being positioned as either a symbolic or substantive centerpiece of america s technological prowess the space station budget has rightly been slashed space is virtually ignored when the administration champions its competitiveness agenda i wish this had happened years ago instead of starting to happen now says bruce murray a caltech professor who ran nasa s jet propulsion lab in pasadena we ve put off a lot of things we shouldn t have i would rather see a billion nasa doing well than a billion one filled with white elephants

sci.space	diaspar virtual reality network announcement posted to the internet by wmiler nyx cs du edu david the lunar tele operation model one ltm by david h mitchell march introduction in order to increase public interest in space based and lunar operations a real miniature lunar like environment is being constructed on which to test tele operated models these models are remotely controlled by individuals located world wide using their personal computers for edutainment purposes not only does this provide a test bed for simple tele operation and tele presence activities but it also provides for the sharing of information on methods of operating in space including but not limited to layout of a lunar colony tele operating machines for work and play disseminating educational information providing contests and awards for creativity and achievement and provides a new way for students worldwide to participate in twenty first century remote learning methods because of the nature of the ltm project people of all ages interests and skills can contribute scenery and murals models and structures interfacing and electronics software and graphics in operation ltm is an evolving playground and laboratory that can be used by children students and professionals worldwide using a personal computer at home or a terminal at a participating institution a user is able to tele operate real models at the ltm base for experimental or recreational purposes because a real facility exists ample opportunity is provided for media coverage of the construction of the lunar model its operation and new features to be added as suggested by the users themselves this has broad inherent interest for a wide range of groups tele operations and virtual reality research radio control model railroad and ham radio operation astronomy and space planetariums and science centers art and theater bbs and online network users software and game developers manufacturers and retailers of model rockets cars and trains children the child in all of us ltm overall design a room feet by feet contains the base lunar layout the walls are used for murals of distant moon mountains star fields and a view of the earth the floor is the simulated lunar surface a global call for contributions is hereby made for material for the lunar surface and for the design and creation of scale models of lunar colony elements scenery and machine lets the ltm initial design has tele operated machinelets an ssto scale model which will be able to lift off hover and land a bulldozerlet which will be able to move about in a quarry area and a moon train which will traverse most of the simulated lunar surface each machinelet has a small tv camera utilizing a ccd tv chip mounted on it a personal computer digitizes the image including reducing picture content and doing data compression to allow for minimal images to be sent to the operator for control purposes and also return control signals the first machinelet to be set up will be the moon train since model trains with tv cameras built in are almost off the shelf items and control electronics for starting and stopping a train are minimal the user will receive an image once every to seconds depending on the speed of their data link to ltm next an ssto scale model with a ccd tv chip will be suspended from a servo motor operated wire frame mounted on the ceiling allowing for the ssto to be controlled by the operator to take off hover over the entire lunar landscape and land finally some tank models will be modified to be ccd tv chip equipped bulldozerlets the entire initial ltm will allow remote operators worldwide to receive minimal images while actually operating models for landing and takeoff traveling and doing work the entire system is based on commercially available items and parts that can be easily obtained except for the interface electronics which is well within the capability of many advanced ham radio operator and computer hardware software developers by taking a graphically oriented communications program dmodem and adding a tele operations screen and controls the necessary user interface can be provided in under man hours plan of action the diaspar virtual reality network has agreed to sponsor this project by providing a host computer network and internet access to that network diaspar is providing the foot by foot facility for actual construction of the lunar model diaspar has in stock the electronic tanks that can be modified and one ccd tv chip diaspar also agrees to provide rail stock for the lunar train model diaspar will make available the dmodem graphical communications package and modify it for control of the machines lets an initial ground breaking with miniature shovels will be performed for a live photo session and news conference on april the initial models will be put in place a time lapse record will be started for historical purposes it is not expected that this event will be completely serious or solemn the lunar colony will be declared open for additional building operations and experiments a photographer will be present and the photographs taken will be converted to gif images for distribution world wide to major online networks and bbs s a press release will be issued calling for contributions of ideas time talent materials and scale models for the simulated lunar colony a contest for new designs and techniques for working on the moon will then be announced universities will be invited to participate the goal being to find instructors who wish to have class participation in various aspects of the lunar colony model field trips to ltm can be arranged and at that time the results of the class work will be added to the model contributors will then be able to tele operate any contributed machine lets once they return to their campus a monthly ltm newsletter will be issued both electronically online and via conventional means to the media any major new tele operated equipment addition will be marked with an invitation to the television news media having a large real model space colony will be a very attractive photo opportunity for the television community especially since the action will be controlled by people all over the world science fiction writers will be invited to issue challenges to engineering and human factors students at universities to build and operate the tele operated equipment to perform lunar tasks using counter weight and pulley systems gravity may be simulated to some extent to try various traction challenges the long term goal is creating world wide interest education experimentation and remote operation of a lunar colony ltm has the potential of being a long term global edutainment method for space activities and may be the generic example of how to teach and explore in many other subject areas not limited to space edutainment all of this facilitates the kind of spirit which can lead to a generation of people who are ready for the leap to the stars conclusion edutainment is the blending of education and entertainment anyone who has ever enjoyed seeing miniatures will probably see the potential impact of a globally available layout for recreation education and experimentation purposes by creating a tele operated model lunar colony we not only create world wide publicity but also a method of trying new ideas that require real not virtual skills and open a new method for putting people s minds in space moonlighters illuminating the path of knowledge about space and lunar development the following people are already engaged in various parts of this work david rob dash hyson jzer vril wyatt the dark one tiggertoo the mad hatter sir robin jogden come join the discussion

generally true i see every single line item on a contract and i have to sign it there is no such thing as wrap at this university dennis i have worked on or written proposals worth tens of millions of customers included government including nasa for profit and non profit companies all expected a wrap usually called a fee much of the work involved allocating and costing the work of subcontractors the subcontractors where universities for profits non profits and even some of the nasa centers for the commercialization of space all charged fees as part of the work down the street is one of the nasa commercialization centers they charge a fee you totally forgot the original post that you posted allen in that post you stated that the wrap was on top of and in addition to any overhead geez in this post you finally admit that this is not true now i m sure your a competent engineer dennis but you clearly lack experience in several areas your posts show that you don t understand the importance of integration in large projects you also show a lack of understanding of costing efforts as shown by your belief that it is reasonable to charge incremental costs for everything this isn t a flame jsut a statement come your little ol buns down here and you will find out who is doing what and who is working on integration this is simply an ad hominum attack and you know it your employer does charge a fee you may not see it but you do of course there is a fee it is for administration geez allen any organization has costs but there is a heck of a difference in legitimate costs such as libraries and other things that must be there to support a program and wrap as you originally stated it you stated that wrap was on top of all of the overhead which a couple of sentences down you say is not true which is it allen sounds like they are adding it to their overhead rate go ask your costing people how much fee they add to a project i did they never heard of it but suggest that like our president did that any percentage number like this is included in the overhead well there you are dennis as i said they simply include the fee in their overhead many seoparate the fee since the fee structure can change depending on the customer as you have posted on this subject allen you state that wrap is over and above overhead and is a seperate charge you admit here that this is wrong nasa has a line item budget every year i have seen it allen get some numbers from that detailed nasa budget and dig out the wrap numbers and then howl to high heaven about it until you do that you are barking in the wind no allen you did not you merely repeated allegations made by an employee of the overhead capital of nasa integration dennis isn t overhead nothing that reston does could not be dont better or cheaper at the other nasa centers where the work is going on integration could be done better at the centers apollo integration was done here at msfc and that did not turn out so bad the philosophy of reston is totally wrong allen there you have a bunch of people who are completely removed from the work that they are trying to oversee there is no way that will ever work it has never worked in any large scale project that it was ever tried on could you imagine a reston like set up for apollo dennis reston has been the only nasa agency working to reduce costs when wp was hemoraging out a billion the centers you love so much where doing their best to cover it up and ignore the problem reston was the only place you would find people actually interested in solving the problems and building a station oh you are full of it allen on this one i agree that jsc screwed up big they should be responsible for that screw up and the people that caused it replaced to make a stupid statement like that just shows how deep your bias goes come to msfc for a couple of weeks and you will find out just how wrong you really are maybe not people like you believe exactly what they want to believe no matter what the facts are contrary to it kinda funny isn t it that someone who talks about a problem like this is at a place where everything is overhead when you have a bit more experience dennis you will realize that integration isn t overhead it is the single most important part of a successful large scale effort i agree that integration is the single most important part of a successful large scale effort what i completly disagree with is seperating that integration function from the people that are doing the work it is called leadership allen that is what made apollo work final responsibility for the success of apollo was held by less than people that is leadership and responsibility there is neither when you have any organization set up as reston is you could take the same people and move them to jsc or msfc and they could do a much better job why did it take a year for reston to finally say something about the problem if they were on site and part of the process then the problem would have never gotten out of hand in the first place there is one heck of a lot i do not know allen but one thing i do know is that for a project to be successful you must have leadership i remember all of the turn over at reston that kept ssf program in shambles for years do you it is lack of responsibility and leadership that is the programs problem lack of leadership from the white house congress and at reston nasa is only a symptom of a greater national problem you are so narrowly focused in your efforts that you do not see this why did the space news artice point out that it was the congressionally demanded change that caused the problems methinks that you are being selective with the facts again the story you refer to said that some nasa people blamed it on congress suprise suprise the fact remains that it is the centers you support so much who covered up the overheads and wouldn t address the problems until the press published the story are you saying the reston managers where wrong to get nasa to address the overruns you approve of what the centers did to cover up the overruns no i am saying that if they were located at jsc it never would have happened in the first place if it takes four flights a year to resupply the station and you have a cost of million a flight then you pay billion a year you stated that your friend at reston said that with the current station they could resupply it for a billion a year if the wrap were gone this merely points out a blatent contridiction in your numbers that understandably you fail to see you should know dennis that nasa doesn t include transport costs for resuply that comes from the shuttle budget what they where saying is that operational costs could be cut in half plus transport sorry gang but i have a deadline for a satellite so someone else is going to have to do allen s math for him for a while i will have little chance to do so i do hope you can find the time to tell us just why it was wrong of reston to ask that the problems with wp be addressed i have the time to reitereate one more timet that if the leadership that is at reston was on site at jsc the problem never would have happened totally ignoring the lack of leadership of congress this many headed hydra that has grown up at nasa is the true problem of the agency and to try to change the question to suit you and your bias is only indicative of your position dennis university of alabama in huntsville

sci.space	planets still images orbit by ether twist ether implodes earth core is gravity this paper both describes how heavenly bodys can be stationary ether sucking structures and why we observe orbital motion ether the theoretical propogation media of electro magnetic waves was concluded not to exist based on the results of the michelson moreley experiment conducted a century ago i propose that those conclusions are flawed based on the fact that the experiment was designed to look for a flow parallel to the earth s surface not perpindicular due to the prevailing assumption that the earth traveled through the ether as a ball through the wind the reversal of the that conclusion a pivotal keystone in the development of modern scientific thought could have ramifications of biblical proportions through out the world remember einstien said imagination is greater than knowledge i dream like this ether based reality the ether is like a fluid out of phase with our reality creations start as a lattice placed into the ether given a spin the lattices both drag the fluid like a margarita blender and ingest it converting it distilling localized mass time and energy non spinning lattice dark matter the earth isn t exactly spinning around the sun picture an image of a galaxy we haven t any videos of them spinning picture us being stationary and the sun s image being dragged across the sky by the spinning ether field picture an onion each layer of which is spinning a little faster than the next a thread shot at the inner kernel would be stretched diagonally sideways its head being in a faster shell than its tail until it finally intersected the ground of the inner kernel its direction vector being straight down but its foot print being a line not a point sunrise sunset the moon isn t exactly orbiting us it is a parasite non self spin sustaining being dragged in the earth s ether field which is itself in the sun s much more powerful field our seasons are the wobble of earth s axis like a top slowing down the orbit of the earth around the sun is all of the stars images being dragged around by the sun s ether feild the earth moon and sun are about the same size and distance apart its just that the time between them varies greatly because the path is not the same the moon s lattice in the ether is like sticking a fork in a plate of spaghetti and giving the plate a half turn the sun s lattice has so much spin that its like the fork has got the whole plate of noodles wound up the piece of light going to the moon can slide down the spaghetti and maybe make a j hook at the end the piece of light going to the sun has to go around the whole plate like a needle in a record before it gets there with a pencil compass and rule draw a diagram of how the moon can be about as big as earth s shadow upon it and at other times totally eclipse the sun look in the sky except for your knowledge would you guess that they are about the same size just because they look about the same size o e o o o s e m or m s the full moon quarter moon etc is the difference between rate of ether spins what we are looking at is a rotating turntable view of the moon only half of which is facing the sun i ve seen a half moon within about degrees of sky of the sun during the day try and draw that earth shadow its only the moon s image which appears to orbit us no matter where it is the light part is the part facing the sun and the dark part is the half facing away from the sun even when it appears to be behind us light years between galaxies is a misnomer the distance is closer to zero as time and matter are characteristics of this phase of reality which dissipates outward with each layer of the onion defining edge ether spin what we are seeing could be essentially happening now the piece of light may have experienced many years but the trip could be very quick our time to time travel or warp space i might consider learning to de spin myself phase out my mass good luck trying to design a propulsion system to drag around a space time locality its like trying to move a balloon by shooting a squirt gun from within to find out about all of this i recommend studying history i d look in the book of life or holy grail etc brain waves just might carry decipherable data i d start looking on some part of the spectra said to be unusable due to all the background noise billion humans i d totally isolate myself record me thinking dog backwards and learn to read what i got microsoft holy grail card for pentium next concluding that my thoughts were recorded on a non time bound media the ether and that it is i who move forward in time i would try to temporarily locally reverse the flow of time which i d start looking for as flowing opposite magnetism pole to pole why not perhaps by passing a large flat dc current through a two foot diameter coil or choke or something and seeing what i could get with my machine s receiver next to it if you don t think you ll live to see it consider this quit putting the reproductive keys of other life in your body all of life s data could be written on the wind ether not just our thoughts dna could be a little receiver or file access code by eating seeds we could be jamming our reception or receiving plant instructions try eating seed bearing fruit maybe those greek or biblical guys did live hundreds of years i m curios to see what they did and ate don t worry if your hair stops growing maybe we don t need to eat at all the cosmos are formed from nothing and that is creating matter i only need enough to bounce around where did the household concept immortal come from wheat is a weed it is programmed to pull from the soil reproduce like hell and then die warning about writing to the past i had a little dream of being in a world in the near parallel future lying along a path of history which we have diverged from there were twelve telepathic glowing beings who looked like an oscar award and who had always been a dark one who looked like us and then myself the dark one was in the process of making the others into gods he had to teach them what that meant by advising them in their past basically he manipulated them into reproducing and raising their children on his seed he said that the little ones who looked different were a sub species meant to provide service he carefully combed through history rewriting it in his favor pulling like a weed anything that compromised his control he enticed recruits by sending them his visions saying that there was immortality at the end of the road for only twelve souls kill or be killed the amount of control he could exert was finite though as at every change he made a void would appear in our reality the universe one day ended meters from us it seemed odd but we couldn t remember how else it should be then some of the twelve were no more finally when he could prune no more and reality stopped just beyond his fingertips he stepped through his portal to the past to bask over and over in all that he had created i made a few more changes and lost my body existing only on the wind moral its very possible to eliminate from your reality the souls whose will s are not in harmony with yours golden rule treat others as you wish to be treated i e you could end up along a lonely thread of time with murderers or flowery brown nosers for playmates its not eternal there s more than one way back accepting rides to the past once here the one who looks like us sells rides he can make you a prince or a queen or you can live as a god in ancient greece go ahead repeat the third grade as often as you like adam henry i hope you like inspecting your socks careful though if he likes your work but thinks you re getting wise he can direct you to cross paths with your old self and you ll vanish as you rewrite your own course of history none the wiser as we pass the point along the parallel line where he stepped back in time his hierarchy will lose its direction he can still make changes while he s here its just that that is work and with every adjustment this becomes less the world he cultivated which loosens his grip and his organization is suddenly one branch less but he can t see the change the basic nature of man is good he had to apply his hand to achieve his world as he now tightens his hand to retain what he built the more sand slips through his fingers how about public computer access to the i r s its our country our money and they re spending it on us right imagine this washington marks the next cost at irs collects gives to congress and just absolutely buries congress borrows the banks are making what a margin interest on our government big corporations are ecstatic if they can do a margin what do the banks do with it hold some on a carrot to the world sure but mostly bury it why food production is gnp construction hours to build your auto the people are spending all of their time to buy back a tenth of what they produce have we been deceived if we are more efficient why is it getting harder to get by what if the point is just to keep the people busy making widgets in that other reality i shouted to the twelve its chaos they said no its order he defined chaos as that which is he was not able to control rain forest the problem could be that all the water in its canopy would hide the location of an indigenous people who have no language telepathic and vanishing the closest knowledge of death think of the spine as a transceiver if it is on the ground and pointed up you can locate it from above these people are probably naive as children but very very tough to kill also they should be able to tell you stories about the dark one that i talk about they can hear him i think that ham and world band radio old timers might have a story to tell on this these people would be on a different frequency than us as they aren t eating seeds famine relief when i make my diet almost all whole wheat i get a huge belly lose muscle mass sleep a lot and get sick when i eat only fresh fruit i get more energy a hollywood flat belly and need a lot less sleep un peace keeping there is fighting and killing all over the troops go in when there is no bread on the shelf its ok to kill each other just make sure there is enough to eat somalia what is disturbing is energetic gun carrying three foot tall sixteen year olds who eat nothing but some roots that they suck on it is not so much that their growth is stunted it is that they aren t dying at a rate of of years per life women with children babes in arms historical references to women and children as a single unit could mean that infants were not cut from the umbilical cord and hence were not breast fed i think that there may be some very interesting results to this such as mother child telepathy and blue blooded infants there are examples of this practice in the aquatic mammal kingdom to investigate that guy is the master of illusion and the ultimate liar he tells it first and then just follows the thread of time in which the people are willing to buy it in which he can make it so he ll play a poker face up until he thinks he s cornered and then he ll whine beg and grovel all it means to him is that you re willing to live on the ground work that he has laid that is that he was right and he didn t over play his hand and he won t need to go back and try another thread of time you have ultimate control over your destiny just don t live along a path that leads to a reality in which you don t want to be a part of i don t claim to be the first to think these things its just that the others could have been pruned from our path maybe these thoughts given to me were laid down on the track of time after him

sci.space	sirtf mission is still alive from the jpl universe april sirtf is still very much in business by mark whalen in these times of extra tight nasa budgets the very survival of a number of missions has been uncertain but thanks to major design refinements implemented in recent months jpl s space infrared telescope facility sirtf a major project considered to be in trouble a couple of years ago is alive and well according to project scientist michael werner a lighter spacecraft revised orbit and shorter mission have added up to a less expensive project with tremendous scientific power and a bright future said werner designed as a follow up to the highly successful infrared astronomical satellite iras and cosmic background explorer cobe missions sirtf a cryogenically cooled observatory for infrared astronomy from space is scheduled for launch in or if plans proceed as scheduled iras pioneering work in space based infrared astronomy years ago allowed astronomers to view the milky way as never before and revealed among other things galaxies and comets it provided a sky survey times more sensitive than any previously available from ground based observations cobe has measured the infrared and microwave background radiation on large angular scales and revealed new facts about the early universe but to illuminate sirtf s potential jim evans jpl s manager of astrophysics and fundamental physics pre projects recently said that the project is to million times more capable than iras based on technological advances in infrared detector arrays however despite the enormous strides in infrared exploration sirtf promised and the fact that it was cited as the highest priority new initiative for all of astronomy in the s by the national academy of sciences it took a diet or die directive from nasa headquarters last year to keep the project going according to werner the project is now known as atlas sirtf based on the key factor in its new design the satellite will orbit the sun instead of the earth permitting the use of an atlas rocket launch instead of the formerly proposed and heavier titan the main advantage of the solar orbit is that you can use all of your launch capability for boosting the payload you don t have to carry up a second rocket to circularize the orbit werner said the other advantage to a solar orbit he said is that it s in a better thermal environment away from the heat of the earth additional major changes in sirtf s redesign include shortening the mission from five to three years and building a spacecraft that is less than half as heavy as in the original plan atlas sirtf will weigh kilograms pounds compared to titan sirtf s kilograms pounds all of that adds up to a less stressful launch environment werner said and a cost savings of more than million for the launch in addition to increased savings in the design of the smaller less massive spacecraft werner said sirtf s redesign came as a result of congress telling nasa you re trying to do too many things if you want us to support sirtf which is a good project develop a plan to see how it fits into nasa s overall strategy shortly thereafter sirtf was named as nasa s highest priority flagship scientific mission by the interdisciplinary space sciences advisory committee in addition to the blessing from the national academy of sciences while the spacecraft and its instruments required descoping to keep the project alive sirtf s major scientific contribution always promised to come about from its advanced infrared detector arrays which will allow images to be developed tens of thousands of times faster than before according to evans up until a couple of years ago werner said all infrared astronomy was done with single detectors or very small arrays of individually assembled detectors since then the department of defense has developed a program to produce arrays of tens or hundreds of thousands of detectors rather than just a few and those are very well suited for use on sirtf werner noted that in addition to dealing with budget pressures congress is currently watching nasa projects with an eye out for any technological spinoff on that question i think we have some things to say he said because the detectors we re using are straight off various military developments also sirtf will be built by the u s aerospace industry and it s a real technological and engineering challenge in addition to being a tremendous scientific project sirtf will be used by the entire astronomical community werner added but the revised three year mission puts a premium on observing time we have to educate the user community and develop a program that involves early surveys and quick turnaround of the data werner said the downsizing of the project required a reduction in scope and complexity of sirtf s three instruments the infrared spectrograph infrared array camera and multiband imaging photometer however these reductions will only result in losses of efficiency rather than capability he said the project hopes to start a phase b activity in which will provide a detailed concept for development and design building the hardware would begin about two years later projected cost estimates evans said are million million i am very optimistic about sirtf he said it will provide a tremendous return for the investment werner added that an additional benefit from the project will be the enrichment of our intellectual and cultural environment people on the street are very interested in astronomy black holes the possibility of life on other planets the origin of the universe and those are the kind of questions sirtf will help answer ron baalke baalke kelvin jpl nasa gov jet propulsion lab m s telos the aweto from new

sci.space	jpl s vlbi project meets with international space agencies from the jpl universe april vlbi project meets with international space agencies by ed mcnevin members of jpl s space very long baseline interferometry vlbi project team recently concluded a week long series of meetings with officials from russia and japan the meetings were part of space vlbi week held at jpl in early march and were intended to maintain cooperation between international space agencies participating in the development of the u s space vlbi project a recently approved jpl flight project set for launch in u s space vlbi will utilize two earth orbiting spacecraft the japanese vsop vlbi space observing program satellite with its meter radio telescope and a russian radioastron meter satellite both spacecraft will team up with ground based radio telescopes located around the world to create a radio telescope network that astronomers hope will expand radio telescope observing power by a factor of japan s vsop satellite will use a limited six hour orbit to conduct imaging science while the russian radioastron spacecraft will exploit a larger hour earth orbit to conduct exploratory radio astronomy each satellite will point at a source target for roughly hours while approximately ground based radio telescopes will simultaneously point at the same source object while within view on earth according to dr joel smith jpl s project manager for the u s space vlbi meetings like those held at jpl will permit japan and russia who have little previous experience in radio interferometry to establish working relationships with the radio astronomy communities that will be vital during the complex observations required by the space vlbi project one of our main activities is developing the methodology for international coordination because the two spacecraft simultaneously rely on the corresponding tracking stations while using the ground based radio telescopes to observe the same celestial objects said smith three new tracking antennas are being built at dsn facilities and other three other tracking facilities located in japan russia and green bank w va this global network of ground based radio telescopes will use precision clocks and high speed recorders to collect observation data and forward the information to a correlator located at the national radio astronomy observatory in socorro n m the correlator will combine and process data then make it available to mission investigators in moscow tokyo and jpl via electronic mail smith is optimistic that the massive radio telescope created by the space vlbi network will provide radio astronomers with better resolution than has ever been achieved before by ground based radio telescopes allowing astronomers to take a closer look at distant objects in space there is a long history of radio astronomy using ground based telescopes said smith what we intend to do is to extend radio astronomy into earth orbit our goal is to look deeper into the cores of galactic nuclei quasars and other active radio sources to understand what drives those things we have seen so far with radio astronomy smith noted that if one examines the active galactic nuclei you ll find jets appearing to spew at speeds greater than light and at energy levels that are millions of times greater than you would expect he said some astronomers believe that black holes may be located in the cores of these galaxies and that they may fuel the jets smith hopes that by using space vlbi to look further into the cores this theory may be supported or disproved russian space flight hardware including transponders and transmitters are now being tested in the united states and japanese hardware is scheduled to arrive for testing later this year analysis of this hardware will permit u s scientists and engineers to understand how to modify the high speed vlba correlator operating at the nrao in order to accommodate the odd data patterns that will originate from the more than ground based radio telescopes involved in space vlbi smith is particularly pleased that meetings with the japanese and russian space agency officials like those held at jpl in march have proceeded smoothly yet he knows that the political uncertainty in russia could jeopardize that country s participation in the project nothing is ever smooth he said but the russians have been incredibly open with us we always anticipated some likelihood that we will not succeed because of political factors beyond our control yet there tends to be a way of keeping these things going because scientists on both sides are trying hard and people recognize the value of cooperation at this level smith points out that the japanese space agency has more at stake than just fulfilling an international commitment to a science mission the japanese have been extremely cooperative since international cooperation is essential to their science mission he said but smith also noted that japanese space agency officials look at the u s space vlbi mission as an opportunity to showcase the technology involved with vsop spacecraft and their highly regarded mach v launch vehicle yet regardless of the risks involved in undertaking such an ambitious project jpl s smith is satisfied that planning for the space vlbi project is beyond the significant financial and political hurdles that otherwise might threaten the project fortunately we have the virtue of having two partners and if either falls out we would still have something with the other by themselves

discussed in addition it is briefly demonstrated that the position of the japanese amateur satellite jas which was launched with the egs was accurately determined by means of a satellite tracking

scientific unions middle atmosphere program handbook for map vol p publication date jun as the first attempt among mst mesosphere stratosphere troposphere type radars the mu middle and upper atmosphere radar features an active phased array system unlike the conventional large vhf radars in which output power of a large vacuum tube is distributed to individual antenna elements each of solid state power amplifier feeds each antenna element this system configuration enables very fast beam steering as well as various flexible operations by dividing the antenna into independent subarrays because phase shift and signal division combination are performed at a low signal level using electronic devices under control of a computer network the antenna beam can be switched within microsec to any direction within the zenith angle of deg since a precise phase alignment of each element is crucial to realize the excellent performance of this system careful calibration of the output phase of each power amplifier and antenna element was carried out among various aircraft which may be used for this purpose artificial satellites have an advantage of being able to make a long term monitoring with the same system an antenna pattern monitoring system for the mu radar was developed using the scientific satellite ohzora exos c a receiver named mum mu radar antenna monitor on

sci.space	rimsat us russian joint venture i ve been to three talks in the last month which might be of interest i ve transcribed some of my notes below since my note taking ability is by no means infallible please assume that all factual errors are mine permission is granted to copy this without restriction michael sternberg cheif of operations of rimsat was invited to speak at an informal lunch held by acdis here on the campus of the university of illinois acdis is an organization on campus that deals with arms control disarmament and international security rimsat was considered an appropriate topic because the company is using russian launchers and satellites i think it also helped that his daughter is a grad student in the international relations program the concept behind rimsat apparently began when matt neilson went to tonga to visit a friend while he was there he somehow ended up visiting the king who happened to be a big tv fan matt bought the king a satellite dish which the king thought was really nifty since tonga has a gnp of about million his majesty asked if there was any way to make money off this matt thought there probably was so at his suggestion tonga applied for geosynchronous satellite slots while this isn t entirely off the wall it was very unusual seeing as tonga was a tiny kingdom with no space program and is a lot of slots the whole thing was debated in the appropriate regulatory agency and carl hilliard who is apparently a respected space lawyer wrote several opinions supporting tonga s case eventually tonga ended up with slots ranging from e to e slots are designated by the longitude over which they reside according to sternberg four of these from e to e are the best in the world because they are excellently placed for communications between hawaii and the pacific rim rimsat was formed to use these slots it was officially formed in nevis as a tax haven they tried for a few years to raise funds in the west however to fill slots with western satellites launched on western launchers would have cost approximately billion it s not easy to raise that kind of money eventually they hit upon the idea of using russian hardware they began negotiating with glavkosmos for hardware mr sternberg describes operating in moscow in such harsh terms that i don t think i ll visit there for a long time besides a significant lack of creature comforts he was not happy with the way that people operate for example everybody can sell you everything everyone can show the proper documents and licenses that indicate they are the only ones who have the authority to sell what ever you want to by eventually rimsat arranged a deal with glavkosmos for satellites at a cost of million however glavkosmos lost favor after the coup sternberg says that this is because they were basically a bunch of kgb operatives who went to trade shows and picked up lots of brochures since glavkosmos was out of power he had to renegotiate the deal with the new authorities he again described life in a moscow hotel in rather unfavorable terms eventually he worked out a deal and on dec he met with koptev who heads the russian space program to sign the deal koptev insisted on a few concessions before signing and according to sternberg he arranged these new rules to allow himself to form another company to do the exact same thing as rimsat the next step was to meet with the builders of the hardware npo applied mechanics npo pm to use their acronym this organization is located in siberia can t figure out how to spell the town i need an atlas and has built about vehicles since the dawn of the space age sternberg commented that siberians are very different from musovites they are hard workers honest people who team up to get things done very much like midwesterners at this point there were some comments from the audience that agreed with his opinion on both siberians and midwesterners sternberg had lots of good things to say about npo pm his company is apparently lookng for million to invest in the firm to become partners it apparently costs the russians about million to build a satellite that would sell for million in the west if you want to give them specifications they ll build you a satellite for the particular satellites that rimsat will be using costs run about per transponder year this compares to t y in the u s they can sell their time for about million compared to million in the u s rimsat will launch their satellites on protons to get the best prices they bought in bulk they have the rights to twelve launches so if any of you need a lift i can give you their address the first launch is scheduled for october and they are getting one used satellite from the russians which is being moved into place now tidbits sternberg says this kind of thing has to be done by entrepreneurs not big business because big business is just like what they have over there except that we have better paper both in the bathroom and in the copier russian launches are self insured the promise to replace a failed launch within months major investors in rimsat include russell which is a huge retirement fund organization cellsat which is a big telecom business in southeast asia and a fund operated by some of the big names in u s aerospace which he says is sort of an insurance policy for them if this really takes off he downplayed the instabilites in the ex ussr saying that we are worried partly because we aren t used to seeing russia as anything but an unvarying monolith italy gets a new government every two weeks but we don t worry because we re used to it he predicted that once we get used to seeing what really goes on in russia we won t worry about their stability as much part of the problem with cooperative ventures is the problem of transfering money the central bank has a policy of taking hard currency payments putting in their coffers and replacing the rest with the equivalent value in rubles to get around this rimsat pays their hard currency into an austrian bank account npo pm then pays their contractors with foreign currency so that the only the contractors get swindled by the government one of the big problems rimsat has had is stonewalling by the western satellite industry however intelsat recently bought three of the same type of satellites which was rather reassuring the biggest worry most people have about russian satellites is the primitive technology and shorter lifetime the older gorizont horizon satellites have a lifetime of about years while the more modern express satellites compare well with western technology and last about years while this is much shorter than years for western satellites sternberg downplayed the difference at these prices they can afford to launch new ones in addition shorter lifetimes mean that they can replace their equipment with newer technology so they will be able to compete better than older out of date hardware josh

sci.space	commercial space news commercial space news space technology investor number this is number twenty two in an irregular series on commercial space activities the commentaries included are my thoughts on these developments sigh as usual i ve gotten behind in getting this column written i can only plead the exigency of the current dynamics in the space biz this column is put together at lunch hour and after the house quiets down at night so data can quickly build up if there s a lot of other stuff going on i ve complied a lot of information and happenings since the last column so i m going to have to work to keep this one down to a readable length have fun contents us commercial space sales flatten in delta wins two key launch contracts commercial remote sensing venture gets doc go ahead investment firm calls gd s space biz still a good investment ariane predicts dip in launch demand ntsb investigates pegasus launch over aborted abort another pegasus competitor is announced georgia launch site dropped from planning spain s capricornia launcher still proceeding pacastro signs launch reservation with swedish space corp china and taiwan joint satellite venture reported south korea announces national move into space technologies space technology indexes through march final notes articles us commercial space sales flatten in the us department of commerce projects us commercial space sales will remain flat in with current data showing only a percent growth over as published in us industrial outlook which was released in january revenues from the us space business are currently projected to be about m in contrast to previous years when us commercial space sales had shown double digits growth rates this year s projected results are driven by the us satellite manufacturing industry where sales are projected to drop from satellites worth m in to satellites worth m in the us industrial outlook also projects u s commercial launchers faces flat demand in coming year and while predicting that revenues will increase percent to m future sales will be adversely affected by the downward revision in department of defense launch plans offsetting flat launch revenues and satellite deliveries revenues for fixed and mobile satellite services are projected to increase to m primarily driven by increased revenues from broadcast and cable tv networks similarly remote sensing products and sales are projected to increase to m in up us commercial space revenues r e commercial satellites satellite services fixed mobile satellite ground equip mobile equipment commercial launches remote sensing data and services private microgravity research lab total annual revenues r revised data for e estimated data for commentary this is the first look at how the us commercial space industry is expected to do in in general not a bad report with most of the bad news concentrated in the satellite manufacturing area there changes of only a few satellites worth m or so apiece can substantially influence the annual projection if we look forward over several years this market sector should retain strong sales as us firms have been very successful in regaining international market share in the satellite business furthermore sales of satellite ground equipment should go up in the next revision of this data expected to be released about mid year data on mobile satellite ground equipment sales including such items as gps receivers and portable satellite terminals appears to be missing from the january data set doc usually publishes a listing of space business indicators in mid year and the next revision of commercial space revenues should be released then i expect the revised revenues should easily top m if the mobile satellite ground equipment are added back into the numbers and the year should show about a overall market growth looking beyond this year s data future markets look quite promising the doc projects satellite service revenues could top m by if new mobile satellite services and direct broadcasting are implemented as planned and that mobile satellite station sales are expected to continue to growth at per year through the mid s my numbers are somewhat more pessimistic for near term market growth but i agree the trend should be for substantial growth in us commercial space sales over at least the next years my pessimism is due to more conservative assumptions on market capture and growth in leo communications and satellite direct broadcasting services i don t believe all of the current players in the yet to be born leo communications satellite market and in the yet to be proven direct broadcasting market will be financial successes nor that sales growth will be as explosive as currently projected it should also be noted this year s doc data is the first release to show revenues from privately funded microgravity research facilities the m shown in the janurary data is primarily for the spacehab module planned for launch in april on the space shuttle but also hidden in these numbers are the projected first sales from the comet orbital launch and recovery experiment module delta wins two key launch contracts mcdonnell douglas corporation which builds and markets the delta launch vehicle has won two important launch contracts motorola inc announced in mid february that it had selected the delta to launch most of the satellites in the satellite iridium leo communications constellation and in mid april mcdonnell douglas was awarded the usaf medium launch vehicle iii contract the launch services contract with motorola for the iridium constellation launch is for at launch of least iridium satellites another satellites have been contracted to be launched by khrunichev enterprise in russian on proton vehicle launches these satellites planned for the delta will be launched at a time providing for at least launches additional satellites in the iridium constellation such as a planned on orbit spares may also be launched on delta although details of the launch services contract were reported to be negotiation and not yet final the usaf mlv contract also went to mdc bidding a variant of their delta ii launcher this contract is only initially worth million but establishes a set of launch options for up to launches encompassing launches from through these launches will deploy the next generation of the usaf s global positioning system block iir navigation satellites plus other programs first option for to meet the usaf launch options is expected to be exercised this year after which the usaf is expected to request launches of up to deltas per year for at least years under this contract the usaf can also request launch on demand services from mdc for the time period with a launch to occur within days of the request commentary if these two contracts are fulfilled they should provide an excellent business base for mdc s delta launch program through the turn of the century combined these two contracts have a potential for about launches worth about m to mdc and sustaining a core business base of m year other contracts for international and commercial payloads as well as for nasa medium elv class payloads will add to this business base keeping mdc as a viable commerical launch company however it should be noted there are risk elements in these contracts motorola s iridium leo communications constellation has not yet received a us federal communications commission license for operation in the u s nor has motorola lined up all the financing and financial partners for the iridium venture without these approvals or financial backing there will be no iridium launches but hopefully these uncertainties will be settled this year similarly the usaf mlv iii program has been the target of several congressional actions which have slowed the production of the gps block iir satellites and deleted the funding for the mlv iii program in favor of the usaf nls spacelifter program at this time while it appears the mlv iii contract will be executed future funding for the mlv iii and other usaf commercial launch contracts is being reconsidered as part of national space launch strategy reviews some opinions expressed from within the administration and congress propose cancellation of all elv upgrade programs including the mlv programs in favor of the proposed spacelifter program such opinions may have some weight in this year s budget deliberations particularly as dod funds will be more difficult to find in the shrinking us defense budget commercial remote sensing venture gets doc go ahead the first commercial license to operate a remote sensing satellite was approved in early february by the us department of commerce s office of space commerce a license was granted to worldview imaging corporation of oakland california to build and operate a pair of leo imaging satellites to provide multi spectral images of the earth commentary there has been little data released on this venture by worldview and the doc other than the announcement of the operating and construction license this was reported to be at the request of worldview most industry speculation identifies this new venture as a star wars spinoff using sdi type technology to provide digital earth sensing data and heavily integrated into digital gis databases for remote sensing gis users most probable customers for this service include exploration geologists agricultural planners and urban planners it is noteworthy this is the first commercial venture under the land remote sensing policy act the act as passed last november provides that remote sensing data gathered from private remote sensing craft may be sold to users at differing prices prior to this act remote sensing data from all satellites had to be sold to all users at the same prices and private remote sensing ventures would have had to sell at the government set landsat data prices there are rumors of several other potential commercial remote sensing ventures working their way through the system at different stages of development i think the large landsat and spot satellite systems will provide the majority of the satellite remote sensing data market for the next decade or so in contrast to these large government sponsored remote sensing systems smaller market ventures such as worldview and others can exploit market niches and use innovative technology and i believe can find profitability on the margin i predict there may be some very interesting ventures appearing in the next year or so investment firm calls gd s space biz still a good investment wall street investment house morgan stanley thinks general dynamic s space systems division could still be a moneymaker despite having failed in the last atlas launches in a recent analyst s report morgan stanley said we are more than ever convinced that if the company can return the atlas to its historical plus success rate this will become a highly profitable cash generating unit based upon discussions with gd s corporate management morgan stanley projects that if the atlas problems are cleared up the unit could see m in earnings per year by and m per year by this is based upon gd s projection of capturing about atlas launches per year on the world market commentary three failures in a row of their launch system has hurt general dynamic s space systems division since gd has restructured to only keep a very few profitable core businesses many market pundits have been speculating gd s space business might be next to be sold the morgan stanley report indicates gd s space systems division has some potential as a moneymaker despite current problems if they can get their act together sales are projected to be about m in which will probably generate a loss of about m if gd can capture their projected share of the space launch market and if they have managed to clean up the reliability of their atlas launchers then they could generate healthy profits from those sales but until they demonstrate the atlas centaur program is back on track this division will continue to show substantial losses in response to the sell off rumors in my opinion this operation is not a really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability to do such a takeover the current set corporate and divisional management would be replaced with another set from outside the firm in gd ssd s case to get the division back on track the management team will have to concentrate hard on the technical problems with the atlas centaur as well as in selling atlas services this would indicate only another firm with experience in rocket launch operations could find such talent in house and be able to convince customers to buy their launch services optimally the firm would have substantial liquid rocket experience and experience in marketing space technology internationally as well candidates for this might be trw rockwell lockheed and martin and possibly mcdonnell douglas and boeing but most of those firms have cash flow problems mdc have had a substantial business contraction boeing and mdc are involved with other launch firms lockheed or have taken on substantial debt martin and coming up with the m purchase price for the division is a big chunk of change for any company ariane predicts dip in launch demand arianespace the operator of the ariane launch system is projecting a dip in launch demand in the late s in early february arianespace released their annual market survey which detailed their projection of the space transportation market for the next decade over short run arianespace expects to retain their dominant position and sustain a majority share of the launch market of international and commercial launches planned through ariane holds contracts for general dynamics atlas vehicle holds contracts mcdonnell douglas delta holds and great wall s long march vehicle holds launch contracts three quarters of future launch contracts for which ariane can compete are projected to come from communications satellites with the remaining split between weather earth observation and scientific satellites most of the future telecommunications demand growth is predicted to come from the asia pacific region arianespace expects the current market consolidation of individual satellite operators into regional or national groups will continue with these groups investing in heavier satellites with larger communications payloads carrying more transponders arianespace predicts the average mass of telecommunications satellites should increase by over today s average level to about kg in geo demand for commercial launch services is expected to remain strong over the next three years but in the second half of the decade arianespace predicts demand will decrease arianespace bases this prediction upon a matching of satellite transponder demand and supply particularly as new data compression techniques appear to could double or triple transponder capacity using existing or near term transponders one of the significant possible changes in the market was identified as the arrival of new launch vehicles including russian launch systems but arianespace predicts that in the long term investors purchasing launch services are looking for the best trade off between launch service quality and price and that russian and other new launch services will have to prove out their capabilities and service quality and their market penetration will be minimal commentary ariane releases their market surveys annually and i reported on their prior market survey in a past issue of csn sti comparing the two surveys there aren t outstanding differences in the numbers the most notable change is the consideration of new data compression techniques reducing the demand for new physical transponders on orbit i note that in contrast to some predictions demand for space based communications transponders appears to be remain strong while fiber optic lines are making substantial inroads into the established point to point telecommunications markets growing demand for telecommunications services world wide and for point to multipoint broadcast services have prevented a decrease in space transponder demand fiberoptic cables provide a higher capability service but only from established point a to established point b to establish a fiberoptic link it is necessary to install cable between the points and while there are improved network solutions installing a large network of distributed fiberoptic links can cost millions or billions of dollars for broadcast services where there is not an existing ground network structure satellites still offer the most cost effective solution and if new services are required into a new region it is cheaper to install a small satellite link costing only a few tens of thousands of dollars and tie into the existing global satellite network this allows rapid growth of new satellite services and has kept demand high the replacement market for fiberoptics is growing as well since as demand grows between the points serviced it becomes cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to handle the increase in traffic since the telecommunications and data transfer markets are still growing rapidly satellite market projections remain rosy but satellites are also getting longer orbital lifetimes current generation satellites are now getting guarantees of at years of on orbit service or more in contrast to years of service from last generation s satellites this has cut back some of the launch demand as satellite owners are rescheduling replacement satellite launches over longer intervals and as last note arianespace didn t flag it this year but it looks like the space transportation market will be rather over supplied by existing launch systems in the near term the annual commercial launch demand is for about medium sized satellites per year from the supply side ariane is capable of launching up to about a dozen medium sized satellites a year delta is capable of about per year atlas is capable of long march japan s h vehicle russia s proton capable of and other systems such as zenit and soyuz another medium launches per year that s a lot of capability for a small market we can only expect the competition to intensify for commercial launches ntsb investigates pegasus launch over aborted abort the feb pegasus launch by orbital sciences corporation has spawned an investigation over an apparent violation of range safety rules a valid abort order from a nasa range safety officer to halt the mission was overridden and the pegasus was launched in violation of range safety rules in the last few minutes of the pegasus launch countdown one of two abort command receivers aboard the pegasus failed such a failure typically scrubs a launch and a nasa range safety officer at wallops island va issued a mission abort order about a minute before the scheduled pegasus launch somehow this command was overridden by the osc launch team or the message was lost in the communications channels and the pegasus was launched despite the valid abort call fortunately the pegasus functioned as expected and the abort command receiver was not needed but this incident did spark an investigation since a valid abort order was given under agreed to launch constraint rules and was not obeyed leading the investigation is the national transportation safety board ntsb with support from nasa osc and the air force this investigation marks the first time ntsb has taken the lead on an incident involving a space launch according to the ntsb their investigation will take about months and is primarily looking at lines of authority communications links and safety procedures used in the launch commentary this is the first time that the ntsb has led an investigation into a space launch their leadership was requested by the department of commerce s office of commercial space transportation who had licensed the commercial launch at the time of writing this column some of the initial investigations have been concluded and some of the results are starting to leak out into the trade press apparently or four different communications channels were in use during the test after the abort destruct receiver stopped responding the nasa test director and range controller in the mission control room at wallops island gave abort orders about a minute before the launch according to the mission rules this should have stopped the launch somehow the osc test conductor ordered the abort reversed and the nasa communicator on the net relayed that order to the b carrying the pegasus at about seconds before launch differing explainations of exactly how this happened are proposed with the best set being that clear lines of communications and clear definition of the responsibilities of the mission control team and understanding of the mission rules were not established before the launch as we see more and more commercial launches more of these procedural issues are going to crop up and will have to be resolved this case is interesting because it is the first time the ntsb has been called in to investigate a commercial launch problem as they do with commercial aircraft problems i think this problem will turn out to be primarily problems with procedures and communications and will be cleared up with issuance of guidelines on how launch communications should be set up and how specific lines of authority should be delineated another pegasus competitor is announced tsniimach enterprise in russia announced it is marketing a new small space launch system based upon converted icbm components two versions of the launcher are being marketed the aerokosmos winged vehicle launched like the osc pegasus and the severkosmos launched from a mobile ground transporter the aerokosmos is projected to deliver kg to a km circular orbit or kg to an km circular orbit and the severkosmos to be capable of kg to km orbits and kg to km also proposed to be used with these launch systems is a leo data relay system called sineva tsniimach enterprise is described as a ex military establishment focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection of spacecraft and which has participated in the development of the buran shuttle system they are located near the npo energia facility in kaliningrad outside of moscow commentary there s very little released information on this new venture my suspicion is it is another russian enterprise looking for hard currency and trying to capitalize upon their in house knowledge of ex soviet launch systems it adds to the list of numerous commercial space startups announced from the ex soviet union this one s a little different in that they are offering variants of ex soviet icbms but i can t identify any key customers being targeted or substantial financial backing georgia launch site dropped from planning in late january georgia tech research institute released the results of a preliminary study on the feasibility of a commercial rocket launching site in camden county georgia at the old kingsland missile test launching site on the atlantic coast the preliminary study recommended the site not be pursued as a commercial launch site stating reopening the site was not feasible due to projected low investment returns plus environmental and other geographic considerations however the report did say the site might be ideal for other aerospace uses and recommended other potential uses commentary this should put the nails in the coffin of the kingsland commercial launch site while other sites are still proceeding with commercial launch site development plans kingsland found without a key customer to act as anchor tenant and if substantial infrastructure had to be put in then the expected returns were too low to justify the cost of development this might point out some key discriminators in judging the feasibility of a commercial launch site these include is there an identified key customer to provide core usage sufficient to recover setup costs is there a market advantage of using the site can existing infrastructure be used or modified at the site can financing be found at low enough cost to support the investment other commercial launch site ventures including those at woomera poker flat cape york white sands alabama off shore platform hawaii and vandenberg have to also be judged against these criteria in my opinion some of these ventures are flying on hope and speculation and not on sound financial grounds spain s capricornia launcher still proceeding in one of his last official acts former president bush authorized space technology transfer for several joint space ventures between us and other firms one of these was a proposed use of us technology by spain to build a small booster with that regulatory impediment removed the stage capricornia launch vehicle will start development later this year planning for a first launch in the time period the capricornia is described as a small stage all solid booster designed to put kg into leo several launch sites are being examined for the system including on the iberian peninsula and on the canary islands originated by inta in spain the project reports it has m in development funding and will use technology from argentina s condor launch vehicle as well as from the us commentary several firms have identified a market opportunity in providing a small launcher for the european market small payloads from european firms or organizations currently use either ariane piggyback launches or the us italian scout launcher however ariane piggyback opportunities are limited and the scout program is being phased out accompanied by some disarray in the italian government and space industry regarding any follow on system this has left an apparent niche for a new european small launch system surprisingly enough esa has not supported development of such a system within the current space funding structure studies have been performed by british aerospace aerospatiale deutsche aerospace and italian organizations but with the exception of the swedish pacastro system reported below i have not been able to find any other european development work with even a rumor of funding for hardware also of interest is the linking of the capricornia to the argentinian condor launcher there have been some interesting rumors surfacing out of argentina over the past year about a space launcher irbm program funded under the military junta which ruled the country in the s and early s what is known is in feb the argentinian air force formally transferred control of the condor missile program to the new civilian argentinian national space agency comison nacional de atividades espaciales cnae the condor program was described as originating in expanding upon the smaller condor rocket program in collaboration with egypt and with support of german firms the condor was also reportedly funded indirectly by iraq in the mid s fairly large solid rocket motors were built and tested but argentinan development of a suitable guidance package lagged that of the propulsion system it should be noted cnae is planning to launch its first scientific satellite in late the us m kg sac b satellite will study the earth s upper atmosphere and includes cooperative experiments from italy and the us no launch vehicle has yet been selected but osc s pegasus and the russian burlak air launched rocket are reported to be strong contenders for this contract pacastro signs launch reservation with swedish space corp pacastro a small launch firm in herndon virginia announced in late february it had received a m launch reservation contract from the swedish space corp to launch a satellite on pacastro s pa launch vehicle this will be performed as part of the polar satellite service pss a joint norwegian space center swedish space corp program to upgrade the andoya rocket range in norway and offering small satellite launches into the polar regions according to pacastro pss is also performing an m upgrade of the andoya launch facilities including a new integration facility and a fully enclosed vertical assembly building for small launch vehicles like the pacastro pa pacastro has been chosen as the main alternative rocket supplier for the small satellite launch service to be offered by pss from andoya the date of the launch of the swedish satellite was not specified commentary pacastro has been trying to line up customers and funding for their launch vehicle for some time now the pa is a small two stage rocket fueled by rp and liquid oxygen from pacastro s literature the engines designed for the pa series rockets are built of off the shelf components based upon the lunar module descent engines built by trw and are capable of putting a kg satellite into a km circular polar orbit pacastro is trying to arrange construction financing for its first three pa vehicles with a first launch planned for and orbital launches planned for my records show pacastro hired trw to provide marketing support and systems design with primary engineering to be done by aeroastro a small satellite builder closely associated with pacastro headquartered in the same building the swedish space corporation would supply engineering launch operations vehicle subsystems and marketing support sumitomo corp of tokyo is a first round investor and sits on the board of directors pacastro has gotten a first round financial package of at least k some sources place this of high as m but has been searching for about a year for the additional m needed to design build and launch their first set of vehicles the launch reservation from ssc can possibly be used to help bring some investors on board but by my estimate they will need much more than the single m sale to put their venture into real hardware china and taiwan joint satellite venture reported in early march it was reported a joint satellite communications venture between a taiwanese and mainland chinese was in the works as reported in the taipei press china development corp cdc headquartered in taiwam and with links to the ruling nationalist party is planning to set up a joint venture in hong kong with china great wall industry corp with the objective of launching a regional communications satellite cdc would cover about of the satellite system cost us m in exchange for rights to of the satellite s communications channels commentary this announcement came close on the heels of the release of taiwanese plans for space development released in mid january in those plans the national space program office of taiwan will launch satellites starting with rocsat a kg scientific spacecraft planned for launch in two additional satellites are planned both communications satellites trw has been helping taiwan plan this program budgeted at t b us m through i haven t been able to establish any relationship between this venture and those of the nspot but there might be a connection while taiwan has the financing to pursue several ventures the current taiwanese telecommunications market might not support two separate sastellite ventures the reported name for the tiawanese chinese system is asiasat but i don t thinks this has any relationship with the existing hong kong based asiasat program involving chinese hong kong and other asian investors other than using it as an organizational model there are some obvious advantages to pursuing such a joing venture it could provide excellent first hand experience to taiwan for a very low cost which then can be used in later satellite ventures but there are internal political issues between taiwanese and chinese ventures but putting any joint venture through a hong kong intermediary corporation might allow it to proceed in any case the east asian satellite market is lighting up with substantially growth projected in space services and revenues this is just another indicator to add to the list south korea announces national move into space technologies south korea s trade industry and resources ministry recently announced plans to invest us b in research and development and another us b into manufacturing and research facilities for advanced aerospace technologies space technologies have been specifically targeted as part of this program beginning with manufacture and launch of an advanced multi purpose satellite by the objective of this investment is to raise south korea s aerospace technology to the level of the world s top countries by commentary south korea has been quietly working to develop its national aerospace industry specifically including space activities i m noting this as a flag that potential new players are coming into the commercial space market as part of their national effort national telecommunications satellites for korea telecom will be launched in april and oct on delta designated koreasat and the platforms will provide television and telephone service throughout the korean peninsula southwestern japan and portions of china bordering north korea south korea launched its first small satellite piggyback on ariane in aug called uribyol our star and costing about us m uribyol is planned for piggyback launch in october of this year again on ariane and will be entirely made in korea uribyol projected for a launch will be an environment monitoring micro satellite this satellite may be the precursor to a series of small earth observation satellites the keos korean earth observation system project which has been submitted for approval to the south korean government would use two or three kg spacecraft equipped with optical and microwave sensors south korean press reports claim there is also a parallel military effort to establish the capabilities for building and launching small military satellites by supposedly a government panel had been established to oversee such an effort funded at us m between and in anticipation of an expected pullout of u s intelligence gathering systems from the korean peninsula in conjunction with all of these reported efforts south korean is also pursuing production work either as off sets to existing aerospace technology contracts for example mcdonnell douglas is offsetting production of some delta parts to south korean firms as part of the koreasat launch contracts or for production of consumer space items among other products south korea exports satellite receiver television setups to japan and samsung has announced teaming for production of osc s orbcomm user terminals this looks like a very aggressive push into space technologies considering that east asia is currently the fastest growing sector for commercial space services primarily for telecommunications a south korean push into space technologies may change the composition of commercial space market there over the next decade space technology indexes through march as announced in the last csn sti each issue will give the results of stock indexes and portfolios regarding space stocks and investments the table below summarizes results to the end of march the space technology index did quite a bit better than the market as a whole as represented by the s p index since of the values included in the index are us firms this represents a general increase in the market value of space related firms the increase in the first quarter is more than in all of which is a very promising sign although future months may reverse this trend the commercial space technology index has also done quite well but the pure play portfolio consisting of stocks of firms which are pure plays in space technologies has also surpassed its results in all of we ll keep an eye on these index results through march beginning beginning jan to mar s p space tech index comm l space tech index space tech pure plays final notes what this column s already full and i still have bunches of commercial space developments to report on as i said at the start of this column there s been a lot of interesting happenings but i ll have to put them into the next issue looking ahead i ve got several articles in the works on new happenings with iridium and the leo communications satellite market more news on international launchers appearing and disappearing on the market new international commercial space ventures and other interesting developments and as always i hope you folks find this stuff useful and interesting any and all comments are welcome wales larrison space

sci.space	space advertising of two developments have brought these type of activities back to the forefront in first in february the russians deployed a m reflector from a progress vehicle after it had departed from the mir space station while this banner reflector was blank npo energia was very active in reporting that future banner reflectors will be available to advertisers who could use a space based video of their logo or ad printed on the banner in a tv commercial as filmed from the mir the second development has been that space marketing inc the same company responsible for merchandising space on the conestoga booster and comet spacecraft is now pushing the environmental billboard as laid out by smi chief engineer dr ron humble of the university of colorado space laboratory and preston carter of the lawrence livermore national laboratory the environmental billboard is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to x meters advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area deployed by the inflatable frame to help sell the concept the spacecraft responsible for maintaining the billboard on orbit will carry ozone reading sensors to continuously monitor the condition of the earth s delicate protective ozone layer according to mike lawson head of smi furthermore the inflatable billboard has reached its minimum exposure of days it will be released to re enter the earth s atmosphere according to imi as the biodegradable material burns it will release ozone building components that will literally replenish the ozone layer the remaining spacecraft will monitor the atmosphere for another year before it too re enters and burns up and adds to the ozone supply this would not be a cheap advertisement costing at least several millions of dollars exact costs were not available but smi estimates that market exposure would be x that of the people who watched the superbowl where a second advertising unit cost since smi is located in atlanta georgia it is being promoted as being available in time for the opening of the summer olympics in atlanta but back to brian s questions and does anyone have any more details other than what was in the wn news blip how serious is this project is this just in the wild idea stage or does it have real funding see above as for serious if they can get m or so my estimate of for development costs and a flight unit plus m for a launch then it s probably real they are claiming to tailor the orbit to overfly specific locations at specific times for optimum advertising impact so they probably can t piggy back upon someone else s planned launch and will have to buy a dedicated launch that s a m cost they need to raise right there and there will probably be some legal challenges to this as well note there is one potential legal challenge to smi on the use of launch vehicle advertising already while i don t think the legal challenges would win out and yes i am an amateur astronomer and no i don t really like the idea of this additional light pollution but i know of no prohibition of it the legal challenges and court fights would probably remove any positive aspects of the advertising i can imagine several ways to make the advertisers look like louts for doing this which would change positive market exposure to negative market exposure and negate the space advertising advantage would you spend m to look like an idiot and light pollution might not be too bad if it s in a low enough orbit and it relies upon reflected light only it would only be visible for a short time just after local dusk and before dawn for maximum market exposure you want to have it visible just after dusk minimizing impact on astronomy since that s the time of worse seeing due to day night thermal turbulence it might still be a problem but perhaps there are ways to mitigate this as for having real funding none that i can identify there were about expressions of interest made on the conestoga advertising opportunity but that included curious folks and was for only a commitment i haven t heard of any serious funding for this but i m sure they are shopping the venture around looking for some money in order to flesh out the concept some more but i am confident there are no firm or paying customers at this time and if anybody wants to cross post this to sci astro please be my guest i don t have posting privileges to that area or at least i don t think i do wales larrison space technology investor maximus wb
sci.space	space advertising of brian yamauchi asks regarding orbital billboards and does anyone have any more details other than what was in the wn news blip how serious is this project is this just in the wild idea stage or does it have real funding well i had been collecting data for next edition of the commercial space news space technology investor to summarize space advertising first advertising on space vehicles is not new it is very common practice to put the cooperating organization s logos on the space launch vehicle for example the latest gps launcher had the very prominent logos on its side of mcdonnell douglas the delta launcher rockwell international who built the gps satellite usaf who paid for the satellite and launch and the gps navstar program office this has not been considered paid advertising but rather public relations since the restrictions have been such that only organizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the side and there was no money exchanged for this however putting a high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras is advertising as much as it is public relations in my opinion and by the way i note that the dc x test vehicle has rather prominent mcdonnell douglas and sdio logos on the side there have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials for use of space vehicles for advertising or placing large advertising signs in orbit on the shuttle for example i know of several serious studies in the early and mid s which looked at putting logos on the external tank or on the sides of the payload bay these ventures would be different than public relations in that the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms participating on that flight and would involve payment of sums for the right to fly the logos in a prominent organization for example painting the et to look like a pepsi can or putting a disneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras would scan past it adverts on launch vehicles the first paid advertising was done on a soviet launcher in about when several non involved foreign organizations were allowed to pay to put their logos on a proton launch an italian shoe company was one of the first advertisers i remember similarly soviet cosmonauts on mir made a paid advertisement for the last olympic games and have gleefully shown banners and other items from participating firms and organizations mars candy bars for example got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the british visiting cosmonaut to mir now us firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch vehicles the upcoming conestoga launch in june putting the comet recoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements on the side for arnold schwarzenegger s upcoming movie the last action hero besides the usual logos of the participating organizations columbia pictures has paid to put ads on the main fuselage of the mission s conestoga rocket its booster rockets and on the comet payload which will orbit the earth for one month a concept for this advertising display was published in space news magazine a couple of months ago as a side note robert lorsch an advertising executive is talking about suing nasa he charges nasa with appropriating an idea he created with the space agency in to form corporate advertising sponsorships on nasa spacecraft as a way to get funding for the space program lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on the upcoming comet nasa violated an agreement that it would not use his idea without him being the exclusive representative for nasa and receiving compensation this is being disputed since the launch is a commercial launch and nasa is receiving none of the advertising revenues but the funding for the comet program is coming from nasa orbital billboards orbital billboards have been the staple of science fiction for some time arthur c clarke wrote about one example and robert heinlein described another in the man who sold the moon several different potential projects have been developed although none have been implemented but the most real prior to being the eiffel ii project which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture in orbit to celebrate the french republic s bi centennial cont maximus wb

sci.space	larsonian astronomy and physics larsonian astronomy and physics orthodox physicists astronomers and astrophysicists claim to be looking for a unified field theory in which all of the forces of the universe can be explained with a single set of laws or equations but they have been systematically ignoring or suppressing an excellent one for years the late physicist dewey b larson s comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe which he calls the reciprocal system is built on two fundamental postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of space and time the physical universe is composed entirely of one component motion existing in three dimensions in discrete units and in two reciprocal forms space and time the physical universe conforms to the relations of ordinary commutative mathematics its magnitudes are absolute and its geometry is euclidean from these two postulates larson developed a complete theoretical universe using various combinations of translational vibrational rotational and vibrational rotational motions the concepts of in ward and out ward scalar motions and speeds in relation to the speed of light which larson called unit velocity and the natural datum at each step in the development larson was able to match objects in his theoretical universe with objects in the real physical universe photons sub atomic particles incomplete atoms charges atoms molecules globular star clusters galaxies binary star systems solar systems white dwarf stars pulsars quasars etc even objects not yet discovered then such as exploding galaxies and gamma ray bursts and applying his theory to his new model of the atom larson was able to precisely and accurately calculate inter atomic distances in crystals and molecules compressibility and thermal expansion of solids and other properties of matter all of this is described in good detail with out fancy complex mathematics in his books books of dewey b larson the following is a complete list of the late physicist dewey b larson s books about his comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe some of the early books are out of print now but still available through inter library loan the structure of the physical universe the case against the nuclear atom beyond newton new light on space and time quasars and pulsars nothing but motion a substitute for the billion super collider the last four chapters explain chemical bonding the neglected facts of science the universe of motion final solutions to most all astrophysical mysteries basic properties of matter all but the last of these books were published by north pacific publishers p o box portland or and should be available via inter library loan if your local university or public library doesn t have each of them several of them including the last one are available from the international society of unified science isus e atkin ave salt lake city utah this is the organization that was started to promote larson s theory they have other related publications including the quarterly journal reciprocity physicist dewey b larson s background physicist dewey b larson was a retired engineer chemical or electrical he was about years old when he died in may he had a bachelor of science degree in engineering science from oregon state university he developed his comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe while trying to develop a way to compute chemical properties based only on the elements used larson s lack of a fancy ph d degree might be one reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him but it is not a valid reason sometimes it takes a relative outsider to clearly see the forest through the trees at the same time it is clear from his books that he also knew orthodox physics and astronomy as well as any physicist or astronomer well enough to point out all their contradictions ad hoc assumptions principles of impotence in consistencies etc larson did not have the funds etc to experimentally test his theory and it was not necessary for him to do so he simply compared the various parts of his theory with other researchers experimental and observational data and in many cases his explanation fit better a self consistent theory is much more than the orthodox physicists and astronomers have they claim to be looking for a unified field theory that works but have been ignoring one for over years now modern physics does not explain the physical universe so well some parts of some of larson s books are full of quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who agree and remember that epicycles crystal spheres geocentricity flat earth theory etc also once seemed to explain it well but were later proved conceptually wrong prof frank h meyer professor emeritus of uw superior was is a strong proponent of larson s theory and was or still is president of larson s organization the international society of unified science and editor of their quarterly journal reciprocity he moved to minneapolis after retiring super collider boondoggle i am against contruction of the superconducting super collider in texas or anywhere else it would be a gross waste of money and contribute almost nothing of scientific value most physicists don t realize it but according to the comprehensive general unified theory of the late physicist dewey b larson as described in his books the strange goofy particles mesons hyperons alleged quarks etc which they are finding in existing colliders fermi lab cern etc are really just atoms of anti matter which are created by the high energy colliding beams and which quickly disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible with their environment a larger and more expensive collider will only create a few more elements of anti matter that the physicists have not seen there before and the physicists will be even more confused than they are now are a few more types of anti matter atoms worth the billion cost don t we have much more important uses for this wasted money another thing to consider is that the primary proposed location in texas has a serious and growing problem with some kind of fire ants eating the insulation off underground cables how much poisoning of the ground and ground water with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of the supercollider naming the super collider after ronald reagon as proposed is totally absurd if it is built it should be named after a leading particle physicist larsonian anti matter in larson s comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe anti matter is not a simple case of opposite charges of the same types of particles it has more to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the photons of which they are made in relation to the vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light which larson calls unit velocity and the natural datum in larson s theory a positron is actually a particle of matter not anti matter when a positron and electron meet the rotational vibrations charges and rotations of their respective photons of which they are made neutralize each other in larson s theory the anti matter half of the physical universe has three dimensions of time and only one dimension of space and exists in a reciprocal relationship to our material half larsonian relativity the perihelion point in the orbit of the planet mercury has been observed and precisely measured to advance at the rate of seconds of arc per century seconds of this advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational perturbations from the other planets venus earth jupiter etc the remaining seconds of arc are being used to help prove einstein s general theory of relativity but the late physicist dewey b larson achieved results closer to the seconds than general relativity can by instead using special relativity in one or more of his books he applied the lorentz transformation on the high orbital speed of mercury larson totally rejected general relativity as another mathematical fantasy he also rejected most of special relativity including the parts about mass increases near the speed of light and the use of the lorentz transform on doppler shifts those quasars with red shifts greater than really are moving faster than the speed of light although most of that motion is away from us in time in larson s comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe there are three dimensions of time instead of only one but two of those dimensions can not be measured from our material half of the physical universe the one dimension that we can measure is the clock time at low relative speeds the values of the other two dimensions are negligible but at high speeds they become significant and the lorentz transformation must be used as a fudge factor larson often used the term coordinate time when writing about this in regard to mass increases it has been proven in atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near the speed of light but the formula for acceleration is acceleration force mass a f m orthodox physicists are ignoring the third factor force in larson s theory mass stays constant and force drops toward zero force is actually a motion or combinations of motions or relations between motions including inward and outward scalar motions the expansion of the universe for example is an outward scalar motion inherent in the universe and not a result of the so called big bang which is yet another mathematical fantasy the universe of motion i wish to recommend to everyone the book the universe of motion by dewey b larson north pacific publishers p o box portland oregon pages indexed hardcover it contains the astrophysical portions of a general unified theory of the physical universe developed by that author an unrecognized genius more than thirty years ago it contains final solutions to most all astrophysical mysteries including the formation of galaxies binary and multiple star systems and solar systems the true origin of the degree background radiation cosmic rays and gamma ray bursts and the true nature of quasars pulsars white dwarfs exploding galaxies etc it contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are all looking for if they are ready to seriously consider it with open minds the following is an example of his theory s success in his first book in the structure of the physical universe larson predicted the existence of exploding galaxies several years before astronomers started finding them they are a necessary consequence of larson s comprehensive theory and when quasars were discovered he had an immediate related explanation for them also gamma ray bursts astro physicists and astronomers are still scratching their heads about the mysterious gamma ray bursts they were originally thought to originate from neutron stars in the disc of our galaxy but the new gamma ray telescope now in earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions uniformly and their source locations in space do not correspond to any known objects except for a few cases of directional coincidence gamma ray bursts are a necessary consequence of the general unified theory of the physical universe developed by the late physicist dewey b larson according to page of his book the universe of motion published in the gamma ray bursts are coming from supernova explosions in the anti matter half of the physical universe which larson calls the cosmic sector because of the relationship between the anti matter and material halves of the physical universe and the way they are connected together the gamma ray bursts can pop into our material half anywhere in space seemingly at random this is why the source locations of the bursts do not correspond with known objects and come from all directions uniformly i wonder how close to us in space a source location would have to be for a gamma ray burst to kill all or most life on earth there would be no way to predict one nor to stop it perhaps some of the mass extinctions of the past which are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids were actually caused by nearby gamma ray bursts larsonian binary star formation about half of all the stars in the galaxy in the vicinity of the sun are binary or double but orthodox astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory theory about how they form or why there are so many of them but binary star systems are actually a likely consequence of the comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe developed by the late physicist dewey b larson i will try to summarize larsons explanation which is detailed in chapter of his book the universe of motion and in some of his other books first of all according to larson stars do not generate energy by fusion a small fraction comes from slow gravitational collapse the rest results from the complete annihilation of heavy elements heavier than iron each element has a destructive temperature limit the heavier the element is the lower is this limit a star s internal temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays gradually reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and lighter elements when the internal temperature of the star reaches the destructive temperature limit of iron there is a type i supernova explosion this is because there is so much iron present and that is related to the structure of iron atoms and the atom building process which larson explains in some of his books better than i can when the star explodes the lighter material on the outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less than the speed of light the heavier material in the center portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to the speed of light because of the high temperature the explosion pushes that material over the speed of light and it expands outward in time which is equivalent to inward in space and it often actually disappears for a while over long periods of time both masses start to fall back gravitationally the material that had been blown outward in space now starts to form a red giant star the material that had been blown outward in time starts to form a white dwarf star both stars then start moving back toward the main sequence from opposite directions on the h r diagram the chances of the two masses falling back into the exact same location in space making a single lone star again are near zero they will instead form a binary system orbiting each other according to larson a white dwarf star has an inverse density gradient is densest at its surface because the material at its center is most widely dispersed blown outward in time this eliminates the need to resort to mathematical fantasies about degenerate matter neutron stars black holes etc larsonian solar system formation if the mass of the heavy material at the center of the exploding star is relatively small then instead of a single white dwarf star there will be several mini white dwarf stars revolving around the red giant star but probably still too far away in three dimensional time to be affected by its heat etc these will become planets in chapter of the universe of motion larson used all this information and other principles of his comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe to derive his own version of bode s law black hole fantasy i heard that physicist stephen w hawking recently completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of two black holes merging together into a single black hole and concluded that the new black hole would have more mass than the sum of the two original black holes such a result should be recognized by everyone as a red flag causing widespread doubt about the whole idea of black holes etc after reading physicist dewey b larson s books about his comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe especially his book the universe of motion it is clear to me that black holes are nothing more than mathematical fantasies the strange object at cygnus x is just an unusually massive white dwarf star not the black hole that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want to prove their theory by the way i do not understand why so much publicity is being given to physicist stephen hawking the physicists and astronomers seem to be acting as if hawking s severe physical problem somehow makes him wiser it does not i wish the same attention had been given to physicist dewey b larson while he was still alive widespread publicity and attention should now be given to larson s theory books and organization the international society of unified science electro magnetic propulsion i heard of that concept many years ago in connection with ufo s and unorthodox inventors but i never was able to find out how or why they work or how they are constructed i found a possible clue about why they might work on pages of the book basic properties of matter by the late physicist dewey b larson which describes part of larson s comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe i quote one paragraph as indicated in the preceding chapter the development of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally different concept of the nature of electrical resistance the electrons we find are derived from the environment it was brought out in volume i larson s book nothing but motion that there are physical processes in operation which produce electrons in substantial quantities and that although the motions that constitute these electrons are in many cases absorbed by atomic structures the opportunities for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are limited it follows that there is always a large excess of free electrons in the material sector material half of the universe most of which are uncharged in this uncharged state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension space because they are inherently rotating units of space and the relation of space to space is not motion in open space therefore each uncharged electron remains permanently in the same location with respect to the natural reference system in the manner of a photon in the context of the stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron like the photon is carried outward at the speed of light by the progression of the natural reference system all material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation meanwhile there are other processes to be discussed later whereby electrons are returned to the environment the electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level note that in larson s theory uncharged electrons are also massless and are basically photons of light of a particular frequency above the unit frequency spinning around one axis at a particular rate below the unit rate unit velocity is the speed of light and there are vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light according to larson s theory i might have the above and below labels mixed up larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass less un charged electrons flying around at the speed of light if this is true then the electro magnetic propulsion fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these electrons or other particles in space perhaps giving them a charge and mass and shooting them toward the rear to achieve propulsion in larson s theory an electrical charge is a one dimensional rotational vibration of a particular frequency above the unit frequency superimposed on the rotation of the particle the paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is generated in clouds suppression of larsonian physics the comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe developed by the late physicist dewey b larson has been available for more than years published in in his first book the structure of the physical universe it is totally un scientific for hawking wheeler sagan and the other sacred priests of the religion they call science or physics or astronomy etc as well as the scientific literature and the education systems to totally ignore larson s theory has they have larson s theory has excellent explanations for many things now puzzling orthodox physicists and astronomers such as gamma ray bursts and the nature of quasars larson s theory deserves to be honestly and openly discussed in the physics chemistry and astronomy journals in the u s and elsewhere and at least the basic principles of larson s theory should be included in all related courses at uw ec uw madison cambridge cornell university and elsewhere so that students are not kept in the dark about a worthy alternative to the dogma they are being fed for more information answers to your questions etc please consult
